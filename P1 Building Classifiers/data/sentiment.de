1 originally launched in 1978 , this popular film was re-introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers .  based on the mighty successful musical from broadway , grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2 ( 6 . 5/10 ) ,  starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles .  plot : high-school musical set in the 1950's showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t-birds ( travolta ) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen ( newton-john ) from australia .  the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song , dance and humour .  critique : fun-loving , energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler .  this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950's , with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers .  admittedly , i am somewhat biased in this opinion , since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth ( grease was one of schmoe's first big-screen experiences , and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble-gum card collection ) , and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time .  but apart from the nostalgic vibe , i was still extremely impressed by this film , as it continued to amuse me , despite my previous dozen or so viewings .  this film took john travolta from a dim-witted " sweathog " on tv's welcome back kotter , and transformed him into a movie-star of spectacular proportions ( saturday night fever ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity ) .  unfortunately for the rest of the cast , his popularity was not terribly contagious , despite their effective showings in this classic movie .  on the down side , some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off ( like when sandy sings about " drinking lemonade " and " staying out until 10 " with danny in " summer nights " ) , and the plot isn't exactly the most elaborate story-line ever created , but despite these small reservations , this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time ( and believe me . . . i  am not a fan of the musicals ! ! ) .  make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player , as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the film's absolute highlights .  and don't forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards , so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever you're feeling a little blue .  little known facts : henry winkler , of tv's happy days' fonzie fame , turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career .  both travolta and conaway were smitten by newton-john during the filming of this picture .  conaway eventually bowed out of the woo-fest , and married newton-john's sister a year later ( divorced after five years ) .  
0 confucius once said , " governing a nation is like cooking a small fish -- don't overdo it . "  his maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script , for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make .  granted , mike judge , writer-director of the workplace satire office space isn't exactly an amateur ( his most infamous work , the mtv series " beavis and butt-head " was pure gold for its network ) .  but unfailingly , judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground .  the iffiness in judge's plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal .  in fact , based on the popularity of scott adams' cartoon " dilbert , " which will soon have its own television series , a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood .  unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit-length sequences which would be more at home on the set of " saturday night live " rather than a full-length feature .  the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space , which feature almost all of the movie's top content ; this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated .  other evidence of office space's failure to work are its lack of good jokes .  the comedy is marginally funny at best , but not enough to get a packed house of theater-goers to laugh out loud .  the material in the movie is on-key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting , and this could partially explain his work here .  however , the movie is loaded with too many misfires -- including the token plot -- to allow for any excuse .  the plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers , headed up by peter gibbons ( ron livingston ) , at a company named initech .  after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech , the movie introduces us to two consultants ( john c . mcginley and paul willson ) which are in charge of " downsizing " the company's payroll .  when peter and his gang learns of this , as well as the reason behind it -- so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) 's stock will go up -- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall .  the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but .  a sympathetic cast and a muddled jennifer aniston-as-love-interest subplot are all that keep this one together , but it's definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent .  
1 ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ?  you remember , he was the title character in that 70's sitcom , " welcome back kotter . "  always trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr . woodman , ever wary of his wife's tuna casserole .   " so , " you ask , " where is he now ? "  mr . kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker .  that's right .  i'm not sure if it's his main source of income , but from what i've heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $20 , 000 at a time .  and there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater .  you silly goose .  well , gabe kaplan isn't in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler's life .  but rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection .  sorry about the segue , or lack thereof .  matt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker .  he's been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug .  he goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win .  in the beginning of the film , he's built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play .  mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia .  mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand .  months later , he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck .  when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash .  although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life .  to make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters .  this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth .  rounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former .  the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren't very glamorous at all .  there's a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots .  except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table .  the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it .  we're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them .  matt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker .  ed norton's worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they're worth .  john turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments .  he's both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro's low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich's heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself .  martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike's law professors , abe petrovsky .  while landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one's self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending .  perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn't seem to have much presence on screen .  she's a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn't be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon's reactions instead .  a good thing about rounders is that it doesn't get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can't find time for humor .  the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales .  one game in a cigar club had me in stitches .   " i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , " says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other .  i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys .  with all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing .  you might think you know a lot about poker , but think again .  luckily , we're given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what's going on .  the narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do .  it's nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world .  as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades .  wait !  as a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace .  hang on !  packed with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house .  okay , i guess that's enough .  oh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein's mother .  
1 for this review and more , visit clear illusions ( www . clearillusions . com )  the majority of scary movies signal the fact that a character is about to meet their demise with cheesy music , worn out dialogue such as " i'll be right back , " or simply with the overall tone of the scene .  how about a classic john denver song as a death signal for a change ?  that's the kind of bursting originality that allows " final destination " to invade the viewer's mind , even days after seeing it , making one pause before ever entering a dark room , taking a shower , or even going to sleep .  the unique and horrifying thriller is the best thing to happen to the slasher genre since 1996's " scream . "   " final destination , " directed by james wong and penned by jeffrey riddick , glen morgan , and james wong , the latter two being writers for the t . v .  series " the x-files , " is a movie with wonderful ideas , and executes them effortlessly .  it's rare a film of this nature can grab an audience's attention these days , as the genre has seem to be completely worn out ? ? `but " final destination " has more in store for one than one can imagine .  unlike " halloween " 's michael myers or " nightmare on elm street " 's freddy kruger , " final destination " 's killer is of the supernatural , the dark one himself , death .  the intriguing premise is as follows ; a portion of a senior class is set to travel by air to paris for their class trip .  after boarding the plane , one of the students , alex browning ( devon sawa ) dreams of their plane exploding into flames just after takeoff , killing everyone on board .  once waking up , alex gets himself and six others off of that plane , all of who seem to be rather confused by the entire happening .  shortly after their departure , the plane takes off , and guess what ; it blows up in middair .  now , alex , and fellow survivors , who consist of friend clear waters ( ali larter ) , enemy carter ( kerr smith ) , carter's girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the goofy billy ( sean william scott ) and his brother tod ( chad donella ) , and teacher , ms . valerie lewton ( kristen cloke ) , are in extreme danger , as it seems they have cheated death by getting off of that plane , and now death wants them .  the number of survivors starts to peel back quite quickly as death goes around offing those who got off the plane ? ? `but who is next , and how will death get them ?   " final destination " is a film that is unbearably suspenseful ; always making the viewer frantic , as death will strike in the most unlikely of times .  john denver's " rocky mountain high " being played pretty much warrants another death ? ? `everyone on that plane learned the hard way .  although it's usually given whose life will be taken next , the intensity and unpredictability of the film never fades , because you don't know when death is coming .  like the characters in the movie , i was constantly nervous and shaky during " final destination " .  the slightest noise or movement nearby would send me a mile into the air ? ? ` and yes , the film is that intense .  the cast is surprisingly effective and up to par ; the best ensemble in this genre since " scream . "  the characters have multi-dimensional personalities for a change , and for the most part , you highly sympathize with them once death starts to come their way .  devon sawa and ali larter are the main focus of the film , and both actors follow up their well written characters with even better performances , that , like the " scream " movies did for their cast , will launch them into superstardom .  kerr smith and kristen cloke are also impressive , although the two don't posses as much screen time as the leads .   " final destination " is one exhilarating , exciting ride .  any age should be able to enjoy the complexity and eeriness of the film , and should find an edge to it that most slasher films lack .  for the blood loving moviegoer , " destination " contains buckets of blood , guts , and all that good stuff .   " final destination " is a film that is destined to become a cult classic among horror fans , and a sleeper hit at the box office .  hands down to the first film in years that has actually scared me .  by scare , i don't mean making me jump , or making me wonder if i'm in danger , but by scare i mean a film that stays locked in your mind , absorbing you , leaving one question that's constantly on your mind : is death coming for me ?  the bottom line : make " final destination " your destination .  
1 errol morris , critically acclaimed director of the 1997 documentary fast , cheap and out of control , vaults to new heights with mr .  death .  this film , an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred a . leuchter , jr . , is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise , stunning even the more jaded minds among us .  don't let the film's cheesy dissuade you .  following this sideshow of horror-lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non-stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter's life and mind .  morris follows the trail of leuchter's madness with appalling lucidity , revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with : this leuchter guy is seriously messed up .  virtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls , leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession ; designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries , in spite of his lack of credentials .  after a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows , leuchter came to the attention of neo-nazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel , who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his `theory' that the holocaust never happened .  morris's interviews are surprisingly congenial , drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves .  zundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch .  leuchter seems completely at ease , sometimes jovial .  part of this effect may be due to morris's new interviewing machine , called the interrotron , which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer .  this was the first time morris had used the device , and the results are startling .  combine the irony of these interviews with leuchter's reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau , not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant , and you've got one compelling and disturbing documentary .  while this film isn't for the feeble-minded or weak-hearted , it is a valuable addition to the cultural landscape .  aside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece , morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject and i , for one , feel bettered by the experience .  
1 before even seeing a single frame of the film , it would be easy to snicker at deep impact , in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet .  it is the latest entry in this decade's dubious revival of the '70s disaster film , and the first of two " the sky is falling " flicks to hit screens this year ( the other being this coming july's armageddon , in which a meteor is the threat ) .  its tagline , " oceans rise .  cities fall .  hope survives " is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight ( " they came in alone . . . the only way out . . .  is together " ) , but it's every bit as treacly .  the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at .  the cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions , such as the usual opening " roll call , " in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced .  the most prominent of the " personal " stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) , who is distraught that her father ( maximilian schell ) left her mother ( vanessa redgrave ) for a younger woman ( rya kihlstedt ) .  what is just as snicker-worthy is how this co-venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration , microsoft and nbc's cable news network msnbc , which employs jenny , who is the film's ostensible main character .  in the vision of america presented here , msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home , when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country .  the initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante's peak , but there's one thing about deep impact i underestimated : the skills of director mimi leder .  she won an emmy for her helming work on nbc's smash er , which is essentially a weekly disaster movie , each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises .  the challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold : ( 1 ) to make the audience care for these guest characters , regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are , and ( 2 ) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic .  having passed the " er challenge " in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker , leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin's rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen .  as the countdown to impact progresses , the ominous feeling of doom is palpable , leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension .  there's nothing here that will profoundly move anyone , but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects .  situations that initially feel contrived , such as jenny's familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) and comet discoverer leo biederman ( elijah wood ) , achieve some poignance ; and even the more vaguely drawn characters , including u . s . president tom beck ( morgan freeman ) , astronaut spurgeon " fish " tanner ( robert duvall ) , and his rather faceless crew ( ron eldard , jon favreau , mary mccormack , blair underwood , and alexander baluyev ) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraft messiah , have their share of touching moments .  the latter fact owes a debt to the actors , who all do a solid job and are well-cast , with the possible exception of leoni ; she delivers a decent performance , but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster .  although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work ( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular ) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister , it is the first of the '90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true--a film that makes a genuine impact , even if it isn't as deep as hoped .  
1 the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80's .  more practiced as a cinematographer than a director , bava nonetheless sat in the director's chair for beyond the door ii , the project which turned out to be his last full-length feature film .  alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci , beyond the door ii is simply a revelation .  in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker , yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970's .   ( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist-rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . )  this story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco .  the film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband's suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier .  they hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on .  to reveal any more of the story would be unfair .  suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english .  bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento .  her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora's troubled soul .  the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd-sounding 70's rock with classic gothic piano sequences .  and there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair .  yet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal .  lamberto bava and francesco barbieri's script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap .  scholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential .  
0 capsule : gal is a 50s-ish london cockney gangster who has retired to spain .  his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he can't refuse .  a standout performance by ben kingsley as don cannot save what is essentially a set of cliches recycled from old westerns .   , 0 ( -4 to +4 )  roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , " who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . .  ben kingsley ? "  my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it .  they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles .  the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious .  that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast .  gary " gal " dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain .  life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing .  but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch .  the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa .  the second punch comes from gal's past .  back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal .  he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal .  don will accept any decision gal makes from " yes " to " certainly . "  however , if gal says " no " don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) .  in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin .  kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness .  there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming .  when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success .  beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him .  any local hood could have done what gal is needed for .  additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault .  no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool .  in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar .  i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade .  the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability .  the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im .  it is not a great plot .  in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards .  perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film .  it is an old plot dressed up to look new .  if the plot is old , at least the style is creative .  this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout .  his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences .  cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes .  we see one side of a person's faces .  but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit .  half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden .  we yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog .  at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language .  sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film .  the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western .  further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance .  i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  
0 part buddy comedy , part fish-out-of-water story , part nature tale , meet the deedles is not nearly as interesting as any of those archetypes .  in fact , it is an invitation you ought to disregard .  phil and stew deedle ( paul walker and steve van wormer ) are the twin sons of the famous millionaire , elton deedle ( eric braeden ) , founder of deedle enterprises .  elton wants his sons to be the perfect heirs to his fortune . . . instead  the two are careless hawaiian surf bums .  to set them straight , he enrolls them into a strict wyoming boot camp , to which the pair inevitably go .  after several misadventures in wyoming , where the duo is stunned to discover there's no surf , the brothers deedle stumble upon a routine mistaken identity plot .  they arrive at yellowstone national park , where they are believed to be two new park ranger recruits .  rather than slinking back home and disappointing their dad , the deedles play along .  phil , actually , has other motives : the beautiful park ranger jesse ( a .  j . langer ) , who unfortunately happens to be the beloved stepdaughter of the overprotective park ranger captain douglas pine ( john ashton ) .  yellowstone has a problem .  it's only a week before the famous geyser old faithful celebrates its one billionth birthday , and the park is being overrun with prairie dogs .  not just one or two . . . thousands of them .  the deedles are assigned to eliminate the p . dog menace , not knowing that it all is part of a fiendish plan by disgraced former head ranger frank slater ( dennis hopper ) .  the brothers deedle aren't supposed to be out-and-out stupid , like the team from dumb and dumber , or bill and ted .  instead , their brains just operate in a different , simpler , realm .  a more accurate comparison would be with carrot top in chairman of the board , a film which , unfortunately , this one resembles in several hideous ways .  the central problem with meet the deedles is that it simply just isn't funny .  there's a moment when phil utters the line , " insert laugh here " , which nearly sums up the entire meet the deedles experience .  the result isn't bad in a run-shrieking-from-the-theater type of way .  instead , it's merely bad in an excruciatingly boring sort of way .  the cast seems decent , but they're never asked to do anything remotely interesting .  instead , the film inundates the audience with countless shots of people and/or cars rolling downhill in the forest , and with constant annoying references to other disney films .  you'll have much better luck finding a good spot to surf in wyoming than finding entertainment in meet the deedles .  
0 some movies' pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they're finally released , everyone just goes along with it .  thus sometimes , films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations .  last year it was the thin red line .  this year's " winner " is the hurricane , pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool .  acclaimed director norman jewison's biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun .  and that's supposed to be ok because , see , it's a true story .  it's about rubin " hurricane " carter ( denzel washington ) , a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly ( racist ! )  detective ( dan hedaya ) who's had it in for the " big-shot " hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self-defense but who cares , right ? )  when rubin was only ten .  he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole .  most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison .  to the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-be detectives .  lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well-off canadian white people ( hanna , unger , schreiber ) to get an education .  lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book -- " the sixteenth round , " rubin's autobiography .  immediately thereafter , schreiber's character tells lesra " sometimes we don't pick the books we read , they pick us . "  hmmm .  after a few visits to the prison , they become convinced of rubin's innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him .  they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses ( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces ? ) and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane's innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings .  of course , we're already told that he's innocent .  a movie like this is especially frustrating because we're not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life .  all too obviously , we're getting the hollywood watered- down version .  that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it .  it's almost cruel .  the melodrama isn't of the entertaining kind either ; it's the hokey , rammed-down-your-throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity .  witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists .  the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it's a no-frills courtroom movie .  it's formula stripped to the bare necessities .  you have your wrongly accused black man .  you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene .  but there's nothing else .  you'd expect some sort of involving investigation .  but that's not necessary since we're implicitly informed of his innocence .  thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding .  brooding to himself .  brooding to other inmates .  brooding to lesra .  brooding to lesra's canadian friends .  brooding in letters .  i don't think i'll ever look at brooding the same way again .  it wasn't long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane's exceedingly deep meditations on his condition .  i wanted something to happen .  as for washington's performance in the title role -- i figured i'd have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it's received -- he is top notch , though still boring .  how is that possible ?  well , he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly .  unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap .  what a waste of a great performer .  speaking of wastes , why the hell did john hannah agree to do this ?  he's an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly , but what is he doing here ?  to call his character ( along with schreiber's and unger's ) a stick figure would be a gross understatement .  all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas , as benevolent as do-gooders come .  if they're to play a major part in this movie , why not make them real people , with real feelings and emotions ?  look : if you're going to make a formula movie , don't undermine the formula .  courtroom dramas can be fun , but this is ridiculous .  not only is it trite , it's boring .  
1 a lot of times a three-star film will be my favorite .  they're usually the kind of movie i can watch most often too .  they're usually not too deep , allowing for semi-brainless relaxation , and at the same time , not too dumb .  men in black is a four-star three-star film .   ( hope you could follow that one )  men in black doesn't wait to get to the fun .  just minutes into the film we are introduced to agent kay ( tommy lee jones ) , introduced to an alien , and introduced to the the awesome memory-diminishing tool that all mib agents use .  after all , you can't have alien witnesses running around with that kind of knowledge can you ?  men in black is , of course , the organization which " moniters all extra-terrestrial activity on earth " .  nypd officer james edwards ( will smith ) , is on a routine foot chase when suddenly the no-good punk he's chasing starts leaping up buildings and blinking more than one pair of eyes .  the alien delivers the simple message that the world is going to end , and with that , dives off of a roof .  naturally nobody believes his story .   .   .  nobody that is , except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of .  edwards then meets agent kay , the man who never seems to crack a smile , and is introduced to the mib .  edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him ( birth certificate , drivers license , and even the literal removal of his fingerprints ) .  james edwards no longer exists .  meet agent jay .  agent kay takes the rookie jay under his wing as they go about " regular " duties .  eventually a far more treacherous event comes into play .  a " bug " has landed on earth and is going to wipe out mankind if these two don't ( or can't ) stop it .  the plot isn't exactly clear , but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth , and that is crucial that the mib find it before the " bug " does .  barry sonnenfeld , who also did the addams family films , directs this nicely .  it's fun , it's funny , it's action-packed .  a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned out to be .  this is one of those movies that is just " fun " and can't really be summed up any nicer or clearer .  will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch .  definitely one of the best films of the the summer of '97 , men in black comes highly recommeded from me !  
1 notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica .  the first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers .  if you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discussion afterwards .  starring : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elias kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan  exotica is a film that grows on retrospection .  exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film .  all of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account .  the director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction .  exotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique .  at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features .  the out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films .  similarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots .  on a first glance , once the multi-plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at .  but perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life .  exotica is very much worth seeing .  it opened to critic's praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december ) .  in canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release .  apart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie .  the spoon-fed-entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen .  but if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica .  analysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead )  what is behind the complex plot in exotica ?  first , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means .  the lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . .  then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . .  in that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other's people lives through a silver screen .  exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner .  exotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) .  in exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows .  second , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters .  the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter .  the niece becomes the baby sitter , the baby sitter becomes the dancer , and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter .  the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter .  a chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie .  
1 in may of 1977 , just 2 years after steven spielberg's success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas' the godfather , a risky , ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success .  little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film .  in january of this year , lucas re-released star wars on its 20th anniversary .  in this new , remastered version , the added effects , which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer-generated jabba the hutt , don't do much but call attention to themselves .  other than these , the film is exactly the same .  why pay to see it in the theaters , you might ask ?  simply because when this movie was released , most of us were a few years short of being born .  we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience , especially if you haven't seen it .  the plot is basic but in the same way , complex .  it has many themes , but the one rotates around luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) and his quest to become a jedi knight .  his mission begins when a droid named r2-d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , which tells him to contact the mysterious obi-wan kanoby ( alec guiness ) .  he and kanoby then , joined by two inter-galactic renegades , hans solo ( harrison ford ) and chewbacca , and skywalker's two droids d2 and c3po ( the voice of anthony edwards ) , wage war upon the corrupt empire , commanded by an evil general ( peter cushing ) and the traitorous darth vader ( the voice of james earl jones ) .  skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger : the force .  the film is obviously quite star-studded .  but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones' voice would appear so many more times in the future ?  it just happened to work out for him .  the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker's triumph is symbolized by the audience's sense of becoming something larger than life itself-a universe of fans , young and old , recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever .   ,  
1 when i first heard that disney's next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified .  i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules ) .  that effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation .  when i saw the trailers , i was thinking " hmm . . .  this isn't bad at all .  this just might have potential . "  when i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features .  i have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ?  i was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch .  phil collins' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs .  the score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original .  so , the soundtrack wasn't bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with .  this film could be good . . .  but will it be ?  when i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney's tarzan is surprisingly decent .  the story starts out with tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace .  however , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan's parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him .  kala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure .   " it's not our kind , " he says .  he agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but " that doesn't make him my son . "  tarzan grows up , vowing to be " the best ape ever " , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can't convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle .  one day , a new animal shows up : humans .  this is where jane comes into the picture .  she is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas .  tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other .  even though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong .  clayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them .  worse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money .  will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ?  i'm not gonna tell you , sorry .  you're gonna have to see for yourself .  and see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding ) .  the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in .  in fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox's anastasia and dreamworks' prince of egypt .  could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ?  the casting is fairly good .  tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules .  nicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way ) .  lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson's beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping .  minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane .  i thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn't have a problem with her .  i take back my insult on driver .  it's nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney's most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter .  on the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton .  he might not be the strongest character in the film ( he's just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed's vocal work contributes greatly .  but if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk .  she also has a fiesty attitude ( " i'm gonna kill ya ! "  she says , more than once ) .  i almost sung along with her during one of the film's best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human's camp , via song , er , scatting " shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah " .  i can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she's a good singer .  not that she was the only funny character in the film , though .  wayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into " un-sanitary " water .   ( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence-that would have killed the picture ) .  the songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins .  this sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing .  i tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace .  the story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules .  if there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the 'n sync version of " trashing the camp " from the film .  i heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be .  i was upset that it wasn't , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like 'n sync to see tarzan .  oh , well . . .  overall , i was enthralled with tarzan .  i wouldn't hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all-time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney's greatest achievements .  i give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough's tarzan .  
1 the year is 1962 and the military is conducting nuclear testings .  involved in these tests is hank marshall ( jones ) , an army colonel who is critical of the above-ground tests that are being done .  he urges below-ground tests which no one will consider at the time until it is learned that the soviets have conducted underground tests of their own .  marshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to carly ( lange ) who is topless on the base's beach in full view of the entire personnel .  hank's reaction is one of amusement .  he's been here before and he deals with it in the only way he knows how .  the problem is carly is a manic-depressive and when she isn't flirting with any man who happens to be near her , she's fantasizing about a fictious world where she'd rather be .  typical of the mental illness , she also is promiscuous and foul-tempered .  the mood swings are quick and violent and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is considerable .  from hank's reports which state his opposition to the army's methods of testing , he is transferred from hawaii to alabama .  carly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become marilyn monroe , bleach-blond and all .  the new home in alabama is pretty run-down and depressing and sets carly off on a violent tantrum .  after meeting his new commanding officer ( booth ) , hank sees an all too familiar pattern begin to repeat .  carly openly flirts with the co . hank tries to deal with the situation , but his only resort is to carry her off and throw her into a nearby pool .  arguments ensue .  the family becomes even more alienated .  the co is very interested in pursuing an encounter with carly and sends hank off to observe an underground test which causes the irradiation of two local ranchers , much to the vocal objections of hank , who spots them but is unable to cancel the detonation of the bomb .  back at home , the two girls try to hold things together but they wonder why their father can't deal with their mother's problems .  one daughter says , " he's blind and she's crazy . "  the other answers , " they're perfect for each other . "  it reaches the breaking point when the older girl ( locane ) and a boy , the co's son ( o'donnell ) see her mother and the co making love in an abandoned shed .  she forces her mother to tell hank and get it all out into the open .  hank returns home and finds his wife in the middle of a musical put on by the military wives , including the co's wife ( snodgress ) .  he confronts the c . o .  but not about carly .  he is upset over the coverup surrounding the accident during the testing .  a fight breaks out between the two when the co accuses hank of not being able to satisfy his wife .  hank is arrested .  what follows is manipulation and revenge on the part of the co . he convinces carly to commit hank to a hospital for observation .  instead , they fill him with so many drugs that he can barely cope .  he foams at the mouth and cannot even finish sewing a leather wallet as presents for his daughters .  carly is determined to free her husband from the clutches of the army and succeeds in doing so only by being the strong one in the family for the first time .  the film has an upbeat ending with hope that the family has found a way to deal with its problems .  the performances are solid throughout .  jones is sympathetic and loving and is most effective in those quiet moments when he tries to deal with his wife's rage .  he comforts her and offers protection .  lange gives a strong and spirited portrayal of a woman on the edge who draws up the courage to try and put things right for her family .  amy locane is very good as she fights to keep her family together while struggling with her own doubts as to whether she even should .  blue sky is based on the story of the stagner family .  the screenplay was written by rama laurie stagner ( with arlene sarner and jerry leichtling ) .  the film marks the final work of tony richardson who died shortly after its completion in 1991 .  he had made such classics as look back in anger ( 1958 ) and tom jones ( 1963 ) .  orion pictures underwent bankruptcy and caused the film to sit on a shelf for three years .  the film joins an alread promising fall line-up of films and is well worth catching for the performances alone .  
1 jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance .  for the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film .  daryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes .  the parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine ) .  he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes .  however zero's observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society .  he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr . watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller ) .  arlo is not happy with his job .  he is thrilled to be around zero's brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer .  and they're even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend's boss means more to arlo than her .  this is the situation when a new case comes knocking .  gregory stark ( ryan o'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys .  it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence .  now , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end .  to solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell .  however , this is when he is vulnerable . . . and  this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme .  for the first time , zero has to question his own objectivity , as he finds his client less and less sympathetic .  zero effect is weakest in its obviously " wacky " scenes depicting daryl zero's odd behavior .  such scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character .  however , there's a much meatier movie in here . . . it just takes a while to get out .  that's not to say that there's not a place for humor in this film .  in fact , some of the best scenes are ben stiller's wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer .  however , the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film , and they aren't funny enough to stand on their own .  once the investigation is underway , however , zero's brilliance really begins to shine .  his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock's own .  as the mystery begins to unfold , zero's deductions lead the plot in interesting directions , but never lose the viewer .  zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well .  zero's relationship with gloria is low-key , but it hits all the right notes .  however , we are always kept distant from gloria's character .  she's given plenty of development , but we never understand what she is thinking .  perhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero's zone of detachment .  but , on the whole , it is frustrating .  bill pullman , when he's not spacing out , creates a vibrant character in daryl zero .  there's one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years , and it is shockingly moving . . . expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character , but one which fits in well .  and , although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called " zero " seriously , it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name .  although zero effect is a bit awkward in places , it is a strong debut for kasdan , and shows great promise .  
0 sandra bullock in high heels and wielding a chainsaw ?  yup , it's gotta be summer .  just when you thought the pointless sequel had gone the way of franchise films and direct-to-video releases , into port slams speed 2 : cruise control , the gloriously godawful follow-up to the 1994 sleeper about a bus rigged to explode if it slowed below a certain speed .  the gimmick , this time , is an ocean liner rigged to , well , crash into stuff .  sound exciting ?  dennis hopper's disgruntled bomb squader , the villain of the first film , has given way to willem dafoe's disgruntled computer programmer , a maniac whose main beef has something to do with having to use live leeches , i kid you not , as a self-treatment for copper poison- ing .   ( and said poisoning induced by prolonged exposure to electro- magnetic fields , no less !  calling dean edell . . . )  so , he overrides the boat's computer , convinces the crew to abandon ship , and sends the remaining passengers , those who couldn't evacuate in time , on a col- lision course with destiny .   ( oddly , no one thinks to just . . .  jump off the back of the boat . )  with keanu reeves electing not to return-- perhaps he read the script ? --  the job of john mcclane goes to jason patric ( sleepers ) , as the * second * la cop and swat team member that that bus drivin' babe annie ( bullock ) has dated .   ( what are the odds ? )  they're on this caribbean cruise for pleasure , as are a handful of requisite stock characters , including a deaf teenager ( ! ) who has a crush on the hero ( ! ! ) who also knows how to sign ( ! ! ! ) .   ( and you thought the raptor slam was a cool summer movie move ?  wait till you see the feats that * this * little girl can do , when stuck on a shipboard elevator ! )  bullock is her pesky , perky self , though she ends up with far less screen time than her top billing suggests .   ( those paying attention to her bikini- and tank- tops probably won't complain , however ) patric is the main man in motion and that's damn good , 'cause when he stops to talk , he's only slightly less monotone than his predecessor .   ( his first lol line is to ms . bullock : " i'd like to boogie with you . " )  of course , nobody in front of the camera embarrasses themselves quite the way that returning director jan de bont does .  he also produced this mess , which is insulting even by the most lax summer standards .   ( con air , buddy , father's day , romy and michelle's high school reunion , murder at 1600 , 8 heads in a duffle bag , anaconda , vegas vacation , meet wally sparks , metro , bevery hills ninja , the relic , all is forgiven ) .  worse , he's spent a hundred mil on a premise that doesn't even live up to its title !  there's no sweat-inducing motion of the ocean here-- just two hours of shaky handheld camera work and a handful of cross-cut exteriors , all leading up to the big slam , when the love boat sideswipes an oil tanker and then plows into a harbor town .   ( oh , how far we've come in twenty years .  remember the simple fun of seeing a locomotive smash into railway station in the silver streak ? )  admittedly , either of the aforementioned sequences is worth the price of admission .  it's just the rest of the movie-- the other hundred or so minutes-- that's pure nonsense .  and wonderful nonsense at that .  i know he didn't intend to , but de bont has done one thing right : he's created the hands-down funniest film of the year .  so , now , allow to present a few more things that made me laugh :  o a box with a big label : " fiber optic converter "  o plain english , whole-sentence computer instructions  o an entire sequence devoted to opening a fire door  o jason patric's character walks onto the bridge and immediately understands everything that's happening  o a ships' navigator who speaks in a scottish accent and actually gets to say " i canna override it !

0 synopsis : nice girl susanne has sex with her boyfriend daniel in his car , visits daniel's rich family during thanksgiving at their mansion in the middle of nowhere , and has sex with daniel again in the basement .  susanne and daniel must then decide where to hide from evil art thieves who shoot everyone else in the mansion to steal paintings .  brace yourself for one of those painfully obvious " surprise endings . "  comments : thanksgiving .  for most , it's a time to be with your loved ones and enjoy a good , home-cooked meal .  for the makers of body count , however , thanksgiving is a time for multiple murders , violence , profanity , family dysfunction , and sex .  boy , do i feel all the more better having sat through this crap .  alyssa milano , the former child star of who's the boss ? , matures to made-for-video sludge like this movie .  someone somewhere thought it'd be a great idea to pair her with rapper ice-t , who has since guest-starred in the made-for-the-sci-fi-channel series welcome to paradox .  this isn't exactly a winning combination .  outside of permanently ruining a holiday for me , what else may be said for this turkey ?  well , it teaches us that beautiful , attractive women who look strikingly like alyssa milano fall in love with nerds who drive down long winding roads with their eyes closed and complain about being english teachers .  it presents us with a heartwarming thanksgiving dinner attended by alcoholic , stuck-up rich white people waited on by black servants .  it shows us that old guys , try not to laugh , sit around and talk about " the appeal of postmodernism " during their free time .  and , it proves that you can have sex in your parents' basement when they have a dozen or so guests over , and no one will notice .  before i go any further , if any young male reading this has hopes of seeing alyssa naked , forget it .  the filmmakers cleverly shoot the simulated sex scenes in a manner that makes sure you don't see any of milano's attributes .  they do , however , inexplicably throw in a scene where ice-t whistles " jingle bells " after killing people , for whatever that's worth .  this film was originally titled below utopia .  perhaps they should have renamed it hell .  avoid this clunker .  
1 james l . brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this entertaining , if slightly flawed comedy .  nicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen .  he's racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone .  so , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t . v  sitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 ) .  naturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end .  like good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy .  nicholson is hilarious as melvin , churning out insults with superb relish .  only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers .  hunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson .  there's also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them .  kinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he's more of a plot convience than a character .  although his performance is good , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together .  in fact , the scene stealer is simon's dog , who is funnier than nicholson .  but then again , pets are always cute on screen .  providing solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn't as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun .  he overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying .  smith is also good , although she has a fairly small role .  even director lawrence kasdan ( body heat , 1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor .  but this is primarily nicholsons film , and every scene he's in , he's steals it .  he's character is so hateful , though , it's amazing that anyone talks to him at all , especially carol .  and this is the films main problem .  it's totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin .  she doesn't fall in love with him naturally , the film forces her to fall in love with him .  also , melvins character seems to go too nice , too quickly .  i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice , loving person .  it would take a helluva long time , much longer than this film would like to make out .  brooks direction is good , though , if a bit average , but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience .  he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally he's good .  there's also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer .  but , generally , as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do , which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie .  the movie is a bit overlong , but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly .  overall , as good as it gets is a fun movie , even though it may be unbelivable , and certainly worth seeing ( if just for jack nicholsons performance . )  not quite as good as it gets ( pardon the bad joke ) , but still good fun .  
0 one of the responses those that enjoy " detroit rock city " ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : " oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us .  just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? "  i'm wondering the same thing .  i feel like i should have had a grand time with " detroit rock city . "  it's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't .  i just didn't .  surely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ?  no , but i expected something .  a funny joke .  a clever prank .  a plot development .  anything .  the movie never delivers .  you've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing .   " detroit rock city " is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization .  the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan .  that's it .  there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot .  the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) .  they have a garage band .  they're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them .  they have tickets , they lose them .  they get more tickets , they lose those too .  they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire .  there's not much more to it .  frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity .  oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency .  she doesn't want them to see kiss , if you hadn't figured that out already .  it's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this .  we've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy .  then again , " maximum overdrive " had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time .   " detroit rock city " doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close .  in fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind .  basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc's " highway to hell " sounds like something my neighbor's cat coughed up ) .  it's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it' s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie .  edward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they've got to make a living in hollywood .  people wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song .  too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess .  director adam rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning .  we get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script .  it's fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting .  i would recommend that those who felt seasick at " the blair witch project " stay far away from " detroit rock city , " because the witch has got nothing on this baby .  i haven't felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since " armageddon . "  and what about that script ?  it's written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i've ever heard .  if it is , i can't say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible .  a plotless , pointless rock n' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny .  the jokes in " detroit rock city " rarely are .  in fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal .  the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it " comedy . "  there is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don't provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up .  it's as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , " see ?  funny ! "  look , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink .  see ?  funny !  look , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver .  twice .  see ?  funny !  look , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money .  see ?  funny !  a word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren't funny all by themselves .  they must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn 't predicted them five minutes in advance .  that's it , i've said enough about this movie .  it's a waste of time and money .  i liked the music , but don't bother buying the soundtrack .  i hear it' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie .  you want to see this concept executed well ?  go rent roger corman's 1979 classic " rock n' roll high school . "  it features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show .  yes , go rent that , and skip " detroit rock city , " which will probably bomb , and deservedly so .  
0 one night , during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets , we went to see -- what else -- hard rain .   " so , are we all going to die ? "  the sheriff ( randy quaid ) asks in the story's opening line as he evacuates his flooded town .  the answer is pretty much yes , but not nearly soon enough .  and to add insult to injury , the supposedly dead , regretfully , often turn out not to be so .  populating this bad tv-movie-of-the-week material are a host of talented actors .  one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture .  besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water , they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie .  graham yost's script serves up one cliche after another for the actors , who thankfully managed to mumble quite a few of the lines .  director mikael salomon's staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening .  the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies , jr . 's dark and ugly cinematography .  the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water .  onboard are guards tom and his uncle charlie .  christian slater , who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart , plays tom .  edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie .  coming to their " rescue " is a gang headed by jim , played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman .  he views the loot , three million dollars worth , as his retirement plan .  the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang , who are in turn after tom .  along the way , tom picks up a love interest in the person of a crucifix-weapon wielding woman named karen , played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver .  the action sequences are repetitive and without much interest .  they do feature lots of explosions and gunfire to keep you awake .  christopher young's emotionless score for the film has a single trait , ear-shattering loudness .  the plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks , submerging the town .  the characters have an infinite number of bullets and rarely do they have to bother reloading their guns .  the weapons and the ammunition spend most of the time under water or being rained on but always fire perfectly .  when one of the bad guys drops a gun into the water , it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims to get it , even though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees .  counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each other .  the show has a single , but unprintable , good line .  betty white plays an incessantly bossy wife , and , when her hen-pecked husband finally told her off , our audience roared with laughter .  the show concludes with a sickening set of twists .  the best that can be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed to laughably bad .  hard rain runs 1 : 37 .  it is rated r for violence and would be fine for teenagers .   ( the two families behind us shockingly had a half-dozen preschoolers among them . )  
1 towards the middle of " the sweet hereafter , " a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend , careens through the steel guard rail , and disappears out of sight .  then , in long shot , we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow-covered field .  it pauses for a moment before the " field " cracks under the bus' weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment , a single smooth second of time .  compare that scene , if you will , to the last eighty minutes of " titanic , " when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise , and you'll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films .  the scene in " the sweet hereafter " epitomizes all that's right with independent canadian director atom egoyan's film .  it's not sensational .  we don't see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming , terrified children being bloodied and battered about .  the bus doesn't explode or break into a thousand tiny pieces .  it simply leaves the road and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake .  it's a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm and distance .  using a non-linear approach to his narrative , egoyan shifts back and forward in time , connecting us with the inhabitants of the small british columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy .  fourteen children died in the accident , leaving their parents and the town itself paralyzed with grief .  the catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens ( a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm ) , who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit .  stephens , who " doesn't believe in accidents , " functions as a concerned , involved observer , scribbling details in his notebook and providing the parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath .  while stephens' initial drive may be financial ( one third of the total settlement if he wins ) , his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come to grips with his own loss .  his self-destructive , drug-addicted daughter has been in and out of clinics , halfway houses and detox units for years .  egoyan's attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry .  mychael danna , who composed the shimmering music for " the ice storm , " contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles .  equally impressive is paul sarossy's cinematography , capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides and low-hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors--in one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room .   " the sweet hereafter , " while undeniably grim , urges the viewer to grab onto life with both hands and not let go .  it's a film of generous subtlety and emotion .  
1 aggressive , bleak , and unrelenting film about an interracial couple , steve and sam ( damon jones and elexa williams respectively ) , who are viciously attacked in a parking garage one night by a gang of skinheads .  the skinheads beat steve , then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again .  when sam kills herself later that evening , steve decides that the skinheads must be taught a lesson .  waiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely , steve shaves his head , dresses in combat boots and suspenders , tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols , and tries to infiltrate the gang .  as he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend , he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence .  randolph kret's script , based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the film's producer shaun hill , is an affront on violence and intolerance .  the film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one can't help but be disgusted by the events presented within .  i've seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been , but david fincher's film was trying to define a generation .  kret's film is a wake up call to a generation and his message is a powerful one .  if fincher is the kubrick of our generation , then kret is our d . w .  griffith ( thematically speaking ) .  there is not a single likable character in the film .  the skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film , not only because of their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury ( not just against other races but within their own circles ) .  the african-american characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on a joyride looking for someone to accost .  even gay men get in on the act , locating the skinheads' lair and beating them severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects .  the main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge .  what all of this comes down to is the simple message that violence begets violence , and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society .  the cast of this film is absolutely remarkable .  damon jones shows a raw energy that many actors can't seem to summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful .  his initial reaction to hearing about his girlfriend's suicide is one of the most affecting scenes i have ever seen in a film .  david lee wilson , who plays ( appropriately enough ) david lee is accurately evil as the second in command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other men ( an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads ) .  wilson's character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly .  sadly , actor dave ward , who portrays the character of crew , will not be able to follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of a vicious act of violence himself at the hands of a fellow actor during an incident of road rage .  ward showed immense promise and he will be greatly missed .  note : it is a shame that the filmmakers had to add a disclaimer to the end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the film condone racism .  the message about hatred couldn't be spelled out any more clearly than it is here , but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a condemnation .  there are no " winners " at the end of this film either .  no character gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where we began .  where american history x had redemption for most of its characters , no such victories are in store for pariah's band of twisted souls .  it is this bleak ending that carries the film's most powerful message : the message that , despite what you may be able to momentarily do to put your own mind to rest , evil will still be with us ( and in many forms ) and there is very little than can be done to eradicate it entirely .  
0 what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in real life ?  you get martin lawrence in a coma ( the comedian thought he was getting fat , so he put on numerous layers of heavy clothing and went jogging in 100 degree heat , ending up in a coma ) .  so what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in the movies ?  you get an audience in a coma .  in big momma's house , lawrence plays a fbi agent who's a master of disguises .  when a naughty , naughty man escapes from jail and seeks out his former girlfriend ( the very sexy nia long . . .  the only thing worth looking at in this movie ) , she flees to georgia to stay with her rather large southern aunt " big momma " ( ella mitchell ) .  the fbi follows her in order to recover the large sum of money stolen in the bank robbery that sent the naughty man to jail .  however , big momma is called away on an emergency .  sensing that they could lose their only chance to capture the criminal , lawrence goes undercover as big momma .  and let the comedy begin !  big momma's house is the definition of a " gimmick " movie if there ever was one .  the plot can basically be summed up as " martin lawrence dresses up as a fat woman " . . .  and even that description is too wordy .  you can just see this script plotted out on a chalkboard with martin lawrence/fat woman in the middle of the board with a big circle around it , and all sorts of clich ? d , " humorous " situations pointing to it .  fat woman plays basketball !  fat woman takes a dump !  fat woman kung fu !  well they left one off the board . . .  movie critic slips into coma !  paul giamatti ( private parts , the negotiator ) plays lawrence's partner and as much as i enjoy his work , even he can't inject life into this lifeless comedy .  hell , the greatest performers on the planet couldn't make this material work . . .  it's just that awful .  
1 leonardo decaprio ( what's eating gilbert grape ) and claire danes ( tv's my so called life ) star in director baz luhrmann's modernized version of william shakespeare's classic , romeo & juliet .  surrounded by a superb supporting cast , in-cluding paul sorvino ( goodfellas ) , brian dennehy ( tommy boy ) , pete poslethwaite ( the usual sus-pects ) and john leguizamo ( executive decision ) , decaprio and danes shine throughout the film .  the story starts off at a gas station , where the " montague boys " meet the " capulet boys " and square off with one another .  symbolizing the swords of shakespeare's day were their weapons , like the " rapier-9mm " or the " longsword- shotgun . "  instead of killing each other right away , they shoot around , just like in sword fights of old .  another great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeo's best friend .  mercutio , who in shakespeare's novel was quite a stud , was portrayed as an afri-can-american cross-dresser whose violent na-ture , was a definite plus .  miriam margoyles , a virtually unknown actress was astounding as juliet's nurse , even though she was never given a name .  she was the only one who could keep juliet out of her fantasy world .  verona was the home of the rival families in shakespeare's version , only slightly changed in luhrmann's .  now known as verona beach , the capulet's ( led by sorvino ) and montague's ( led by dennehy ) are now rival corporate dynasties .  and their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars .  one slight problem with the film was the difficulty to comprehend the dialogue , since it was spoken in old english .  sub-titles could have helped in the beginning of the movie , but toward the end , it became easier to understand .  this excellent movie poses another prob-lem : what genre is it ?  romeo & juliet contains so much drama , yet enough comedy and action to be placed in either of those categories .  with the same award-winning formula that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction , romeo & juliet is a sure fire modern masterpiece .   ,  
0 8mm is not going to enlighten your day .  it's a dark , grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence .  not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess , you'll require a lot of patience as well .  nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late .  he wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes , and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality .  cage plays private investigator tom welles , praised for his secrecy and reliability .  at home , welles is a family man , with a wife ( catherine keener ) and a small daughter to take care of .  his new assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband's safe .  the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man , until the girl is brutally murdered .  or so it seems .  welles , of course , begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth .  and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case , the more he gets in over his head .  he hires an adult book store clerk named max california ( joaquin phoenix ) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography .  max knows what welles is getting himself into , and explains , `you dance with the devil , the devil don't change .  the devil changes you . '  these turn out to be very wise words .  8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution .  the set-up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her .  this is where everything goes awry .  although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula .  everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless , repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects .  although it had enormous potential , the third act of 8mm is a total bust , leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control .  cage is the film's sole flame of energy .  his performance is actually believable , but soon the director's demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation .  still , you've got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand .  welles' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films in the industry .  this is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer-like phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film .  he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie .  written by andrew kevin walker , 8mm dissipates into a poor man's seven , with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece .  furthermore , what has become of joel schumacher ?  the director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin , anyone ? ) .  this putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career , so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side .  
0 i am a steven seagal fan .  i only say this now because " mufti splenetik " isn't my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things .  any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on .  seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we'll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it's a real-life model-wife who hasn't worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine .  not to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he's been in since nico doing his " my hands are sharp , nimble knives " thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull .  in the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest .  he's also put on quite a lot of weight .  small potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain't broke , why fix it ?   ( more on this disappointed person's dashed expectations later ) .  as jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past .  while he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole .  it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can't trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that " glimmer man " thing .  an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole's former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons .  the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) .  it's the other changes that disappoint .  for example , although there's a fair amount of violence in this movie , there's also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television's " in living colour . "  wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal's bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his " are you crazy " part of the dialogue with wasted zest .  as campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner's eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal's wooden comebacks make for painful watching .  a cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble .  he chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies .  again , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual .  heck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film .  is that a lot to ask of the seague ?  too much .  seagal's best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone .  not for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think .  no kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows .  that's really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else .  we trusted him .  we got to know him .  now , betrayal .  i don't know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he's going to try to be funny again .  i'll try , but it won't be easy .  if you haven't watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out .  it's easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences .  after all , if we can't depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ?  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan .  everybody makes mistakes once in awhile .  
0 hey , i've got a great idea for a movie !  ok , here it is : we'll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so !  what's that ?  sounds too boring ?  ok , how about this then : we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours , but half of them are angry looks and half of them are " i'm in pain ! "  looks !  what's that ?  that still doesn't sound funny to you ?  how about if we through in some " ewwwww ! "  looks ?  still not funny ?  if you answered " no , that doesn't sound funny " , then ( ding ding ding ! )  you're absolutely correct !  for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple ( played by tim allen and kirstie alley ) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant ( wayne knight , best know as newman on tv's " seinfeld " ) gets them in trouble for tax evasion .  what ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell .  what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs .   .   .  namely , talent !  backing up , the married couple is brad and caroline sexton ( allen and alley ) , a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else , but in reality are on the brink of divorce .  just as their marriage seems to be hanging from it's final thread , brad discovers that his accountant , bob lachman ( knight ) , has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton's names .  the irs catches on , but since everything points back to the sexton's and not lachman , there is nothing much to do .   .   .  except run away and join an amish community .  first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle-out-loud moments , and even some decent laughs here and * way * over there , but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you'll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn .  alley is absolutely unwatchable , and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade ( which , i inform you , was total b . s . ) .  allen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons , nor are they very convincing as an amish couple !  this entire movie is one bad ill-conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning !  the amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing .  it's such a trite , stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast ( noticing that they're all predominantly tv figures ) were probably the only ones they could get !  bryan spicer's directing doesn't help one bit , either .  in fact , listing spicer's filmography ( which includes the first " power rangers " movie and the big screen adaption of mchale's navy ) is more of an insult than a r ? sum ? !  now that i've pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground , i will let you in on the best thing about it .  it bumped seven films up a notch on my " worst of " 1997 movie list .  that's right , thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the year's worst , six films are now not seemingly as bad , and a smile like yours , previously inhabiting the number ten spot , now doesn't have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list .  if you look at it in that respect , for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all !  
1 just in time for halloween and christmas , the reissue of the nightmare before christmas couldn't be more appropriate .  with all of the attention thrown to " family films " in recent years , namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters , it's high time we raised the intellectual level of children's fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios .  with that in mind , it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness it had seven years ago .  nightmare is the story of one man's quest to discover his true purpose in life -- to look beyond the accolades of his peers , the achievements of his years , and the praise of his ego .  jack skellington , the pumpkin king of halloweentown , is the main dude behind the halloween holiday for kids everywhere .  but during his reign as pumpkin king , jack has somehow lost his understanding of his place in the world and the magic he creates with his halloween holiday .  after the completion of one particular halloween season , jack walks with a heavy heart and ends up discovering in the woods outside halloweentown a grove of trees with doors to all of the other holidays in the world .  imagine his surprise to discover christmastown , a far more impressive and uplifting holiday than halloween , surrounded by happy elves making toys , and with good cheer all around .  upon his return to halloweentown , jack decides to combine halloween and christmas together by kidnapping " sandy claws , " employing all the residents of halloweentown to build toys for children .  he then aims to take over the role as primary joy-provider and gift-bearer to the children of the world , in the hopes of rediscovering the zest for life he once had .  alas , the co-mingling of halloween and christmas creates disastrous results involving shrunken heads , psychotic wooden ducks , a sleigh pulled by a phantom dog with a lighted nose , and a large , sinister , singing bag named oogie boogie  tim burton -- the man behind such great films as ed wood , beetlejuice , pee-wee's big adventure , and edward scissorhands -- is the creative force behind nightmare .  originally , burton authored a poem that became the basis of the storyline , and he was jointly involved in the production design of the film ( though many mistakenly assume he directed the picture ) .  the stamp of burton is clearly everywhere in the film -- with bold colors , imaginative character design , and it's simple yet compelling story .  the direction of harry selick , who also directed james and the giant peach , is strong , offering intimate views of the strange collection of characters .  also memorable are the songs in the film , written by former oingo boingo lead singer danny elfman , the next john williams of film composing .  the nightmare before christmas is intended for both the kid and adult in everyone .  it's not just child's play for the holidays ; it's a movie about how to be truly happy in a tough world , saying that all you need to do is just be exactly who you are , without compromise .  what better message is there for christmas ?  
1 after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard , out steps a steel-gray , human-like creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit .  spencer , the boy who observes this , having seen his fill of science fiction flicks , figures this thing must be a robot from outer space .  with the exception of disney and a few others , most studios view children's films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit .  star kid stands out as that rare kids' film that is undoubtedly low-budget but is also highly imaginative .  remember , the robot ?  it wasn't one at all but rather a " phase one assault cyborsuit . "  the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors .  the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit , and the cyborsuit , nicknamed cy , has plenty of spunk .  cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like " cool . "  upon hearing that " command , " cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop .  and when cy speaks , we see spencer's view , the backside of cy's lips and eyes .  as 12-year-old spencer , joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue-tied kid .  even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit , he has his fears but he learns to overcome them .   " if you run away , things don't get better , whether it's bullies , spiders , or girls , " his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three .  turbo ( joey simmrin ) , the school's chubby bully , beats up on him , spiders frighten him , and , most embarrassing of all , he can't speak when in the presence of his would-be girlfriend .  with his cyborsuit on , he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy .  spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey , played by a smart-mouthed ashlee levitch , who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker .  stacey derides her brother , whom she barely tolerates , by referring to him only as " the fungus . "  this whole setup for spencer's downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment .  the beauty of mazzello's performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he'll not soon forget .  the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics , but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing .  the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately .  when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire , michelle ( lauren eckstrom ) , his eyes open wide in revulsion .   " mate with her ! "  spencer exclaims .   " pllllleeeeease , i just like her that's all . "  the show has many funny twists .  in one , cy sees a man in a barney-like costume and begins firing at him , thinking he is an alien life-form .  soon things get way out of hand , and cy and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat .  as proof positive of the show's class , it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor -- thought that was an oxymoron in a kids' picture , didn't you ?  cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit , and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet and hilarious .  the director's staging of this sequence is one of the film's more charming moments .  oh , and eating is pretty funny too .  spencer , whose idol is the comic book character " midknight warrior , " gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit .  spencer's valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle .  and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids' show full of inventiveness and lacking the usual repetition .  for a family movie mixing humor , fantasy , and action , star kid delivers .  although it's probably not the sort of movie you'd want to see without kids , with them you'll have a magical time with a relatively straightforward but well developed story .  you'll be rooting for and laughing with spencer and his buddy cy all the way through .  star kid runs 1 : 41 .  it is rated pg for fantasy combat .  although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids , i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening , so i would say the show is fine for kids five and up , and possibly the younger ones .  my son jeffrey , age 8 , got really excited about the picture .  he called it " an especially good movie " and gave it * * * * .  when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters , he mentioned almost everyone in it from the boy to the cyborsuit to the bully .  
0 jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today .  from time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances .  on the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis' king kong .  and , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality .  hush is one such example .  lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn't such a prime example of motion picture tedium .  the film opens , as many so-called " psychological thrillers " do , by posing as a light drama .  we are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love .  jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) .  the moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs .  soon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) .  once that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives .  as long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it's a declaration of war .  hush has three very simple problems : it's incredibly dumb , it's incredibly boring , and it's incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) .  this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow's bare buttocks .  frankly , it's embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange's stature give a performance like this -- it's like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) .  meanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object .  as in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn .  here , it's mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle .  of course , since schaech's character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it's impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation .  maybe someone should ask him if he's familiar with oedipus .  martha is , of course , the evil one .  how do we know she's evil ?  she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work .  on the other hand , helen is a good girl .  the evidence for this is that she's nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents .  that's about it for character development .  beyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists .  however , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying .  i can't imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion .  either there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script .  before the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it .  viewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is .  cheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable .  most entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren't especially good .  films like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along .  in general , however , they're directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension .  that's not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care .  indeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid .  
0 annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) , a widow who struggles to raise her children in a small town in georgia is asked for help by local authorities in solving the case of a missing woman .  annie is something of a psychic , she has involuntary bouts with the supernatural where she can see the past and the future and physically feel the actions happenning to her she envisions .  her " gift " leads to the arrest of a nasty wife beater who may or may not have killed the pretty rich girl found in the swamp on his property .  in an ultra conservative backwoods town will her testimony based on her psychic visions hold up in court ?  do they even have the right man ?  what's good about it :  aside from keanu reeves giving one of the best performances of his career as the loathable redneck donnie barksdale , there is little else going for the film .  what's not so good about it :  lame , unoriginal screenplay .  predictable ending .  suspense scenes that are just plain boring .  ridicously trite characterization makes the entire south out to be ingnorant , hateful goobers .  relentless in its emotional sensationaliztion .  overall critique :   " the gift " is one of those movies that makes you wonder where you've seen this story before .  it's a collection of every cliche and stereotype of the south ever made , and coming from a yankee like me who dislikes the south that's really saying something .  for an established , talented director sam raimi is unable to provide any kind of originality to this film .  it's predictable from the first scene , the screenplay is written like a rip-off of a photocopied bootlegged play .  you know that as nasty as the murder suspect is he didn't actually do it .  it's no surprise either who the real villain turns out to be and what their motive was .  sigh , how trite .  for a supernatural thriller this is neither scary nor intense because it's so cliche .   " the gift " is basically a glorified b-movie .  
0 talk about beating a dead horse !  when home alone was released in 1990 , it was a breath of fresh air , and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film .  the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited .  for john hughes , two home alone movies weren't enough ? he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including a pathetic box office bomb called baby's day out , last year's live-action 101 dalmatians , and this year's flubber .  now , inexplicably , hughes has exhumed not only these worn-out plot elements , but the " home alone " name as well .  the result ? 1997's worst sequel ( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin ) , home alone 3 .  by changing the characters , hughes ( who wrote and co-produced the film ) , along with his co-conspirator , director raja gosnell , has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest .  the new kid , alex pruitt , is played by alex d . linz ( one fine day ) , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness .  he's not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was .  the villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber .  in home alone 3 , there are four of them ( olek krupa , david thornton , lenny von dohlen , and rya kihlstedt ) , but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls .  this time , the kid isn't left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip .  instead , he has developed a bad case of chicken pox , so he can't go to school .  his dad ( kevin kilner ) is away on business and his mom ( haviland morris ) has to run errands , so , for the most part , he's all by himself during the day .  through a series of coincidences too irritating to relate , a top secret u . s . air force integrated circuit comes into his possession .  it's wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex's home to retrieve it .  the eight- year old , who is wise beyond his years , booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg-type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains .  the movie's climax takes place during a raging snowstorm ? only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable .  previously , the most counterfeit-looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii .  these are far worse .  in fact , the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near-blizzard when a shining sun can be seen .  if it's a wonderful life could generate real- looking snow back in the 1940s , why can't home alone 3 , which has a significantly larger budget and '90s technology at its disposal ?  there has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live-action cartoon violence for young children .  home alone 3 will add fuel to the fire .  it's one thing to see wyle e . coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight , but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen .  adults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous , but what about five and six-year olds ?  the level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme ? many of alex's schemes are nasty enough to kill .  but , because this is a " family film , " no one dies , despite being electrocuted , falling thirty feet , and getting smacked on the head by a barbell .  not only is home alone 3 unnecessary , but it's offensive .  it's an exercise in tediousness , and there isn't a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end ( unless , by some strange quirk of fate , you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes , and thus haven't seen this stuff before ) .  i can't imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure .  maybe that's why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb-sucking years .  
0 disconnect the phone line .  don't accept the charges .  do anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `hanging up' .  i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and `hanging up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so .  the film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes' .  meg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer's disease .  while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery .  `hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you don't have the option of doing as the title suggests .  for the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development .  this is an annoying and ineffective device .  cell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems .  if `hanging up' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story .  granted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film .  but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck .  the most outrageous strategy in `hanging up' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale .  we are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career .  georgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called . . . .  `georgia' .  maddy ( kudrow ) , the soap opera actress , spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog .  ryan's convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `hanging up' .  kudrow , so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead phoebe in `friends' , is totally wasted .  ditto for keaton , who is serving a double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle .  her frenzy is apparent .  for a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles .  the reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character's situation , seems more depressing than amusing .  even so , the peak form of humor in `hanging up' is represented by some of matthau's nasty quips and ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill .  that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film .  my curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour .  but really , it's no mystery .  the predictable , melodramatic filth that is `hanging up' is certainly not the fault of these actresses .  pin it on the screenplay , which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes , while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations .  it's certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience , but `hanging up' should have at least been enjoyable .  uh-uh .  it's a wrong number from the beginning .  
0 writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer )  starring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso  i suppose i'm not extremely surprised that " virus " comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it's an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron's early works .  in fact , " virus " is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the " aliens " vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future .  no such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron's wing for years and years , i'm beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him .  in fact , " virus " should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like " virus " is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget .  the film seems to not only borrow it's plot from last year's similarly-fated " deep rising , " but also from a clunkish b-movie from the '80s called " leviathan , " an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part " alien , " part john carpenter's twisted remake of " the thing . "   " virus , " again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water .  they get on .  they break up into pairs and investigate .  and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) .  not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters .  of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper .  and it's not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even " aliens " played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don't give a damn .  i almost don't even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he's a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed .  like anthony hopkins for " legends of the fall " ( the line " scrooooooo 'em " has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) .  or peter o'toole in " caligula . "  great actor , horrific performance .  it happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland's career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film .  though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone's still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it's laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them .   " virus " mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , " if it's dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . "  and if you don't believe me , go back and rent " godzilla , " and tell me if there's even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don't really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) .  but all of this doesn't matter since " virus " is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie .  the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i've ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn't figure it out when i saw it ) .  imagine the first attack of the aliens in " aliens , " shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that's basically the whole of " virus " : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members .  and my god , it's a long damn sit .  with no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it's a wonder that it even got made .  we already know that big movie studios' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like " out of sight " and " saving private ryan " give you more faith in them , but movies like " virus " manage to drain a little more out of the pool .  i almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light .  they read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face .  even though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i'd say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad .  in fact , shouts of " egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? "  are not only justifiable , but encouraged .  
0 ironically , one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life .  unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest , because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes , watching this sad excuse for a movie .  actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn't be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie .  not only is it a pathetically bad film overall , but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever .  the plot is scattered , thin and predictable ; the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video .  it is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica's ( martha plimpton ) house .  but no one has arrived yet .  her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups .  some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers .  but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end .  those who are invited are the ones that have the issues .  it is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms .  first there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof .  he is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production .  bridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them .  they stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections .  he is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school .  his lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch .  as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy .  moving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts .  val is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene .  on the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find .  paradoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren't successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds .  of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot .  wisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless .  paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship .  however , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening .  finally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film .  jack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before .  while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy .  very often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory .  however , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted .  instead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies .  first , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot .  at other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot .  there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish .  not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver .  and yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots .  perhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end .  but it didn't happen that way .  the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight .  
0 hollywood never fails to astound me .  every time i think those coked-up little buggers have hit rock bottom ; they come up with a new excavating tool .  i was truly convinced that " wild wild west " marked 1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless , but then along comes " end of days " to prove me wrong .  this big budget , brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music , grisly violence , explosions galore and lots of cheesy special effects .  the result ?  nothing but groans and yawns .  even the devil himself is unable to produce a decent scare in this festival of the inept .  at the very least , " end of days " should have done us the courtesy of being bad-enough-to-be-good , but it can't even manage that .  it's just lousy .  arnold schwarzenegger , still recovering from heart problems and " batman & robin , " plays an ex-cop turned security agent or bodyguard or something .  along with his obligatory comic relief partner ( kevin pollak , impersonating matthew perry's chandler character from " friends " ) , he gets involved in some major league supernatural hoodoo .  it seems that satan ( gabriel byrne ) gets a shot at world domination only once every thousand years ( and here i thought he'd pulled it off with the republican landslide of '94 ) .  if he has sex with 20-year old christine york ( robin tunney ) , " the chosen one , " their child will be the antichrist , or at least a brat .  ah , but this deal has more catches than a new year's eve pass from a halfway house .  the unholy union must take place on december 31 , 1999 ( you see , 999 is just 666 turned upside down ) , but only between 11 p . m . and midnight ( no wonder this guy is so cranky ) .  and if the chosen one is given refuge in a church , the devil won't know where she is , because he can't see into the sanctuary .  you know , it's kind of like superman's x-ray vision and lead walls , only evil .  a group of guerrilla catholic priests decide the best way to stop the situation is by killing the girl .  arnold chooses to save the girl and kick the hell out of satan , if you'll pardon the expression .  and kevin meets up with an exploding van and has to make some decisions of his own .  oh , the anguish !  oh , the humanity !  oh , the writing !  andrew w . marlowe's screenplay ladles implausibility upon implausibility , from the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his handling of jericho cane , schwarzenegger's character .  cane starts the film a la mel gibson in the first " lethal weapon , " preparing to put a gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the murder of his wife and daughter .  twenty minutes later , he's racing through the bowels of new york city , deciphering clues that sherlock holmes and kreskin would find baffling .  when cane meets up with christine york , he instantly switches to terminator father figure mode , with the young woman serving as surrogate daughter .  in case anyone misses the connection , the camera comes in for a close up of christine's music box , which just happens to be identical to one owned by cane's daughter .  subtle , marlowe , subtle .  speaking of cameras , director peter hyams is just the man to take marlowe's script and make it even more self-important , murky and annoying .  hyams' direction shows all the subtlety of a gwar video , with cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action set pieces , punctuated with loads of big explosions .  eager to satisfy arnold's core audience , he even throws in a few pairs of breasts as well .  what a guy .  had the film delivered some decent scares , or even maintained a consistently ominous tone , the bombastic clich ? s might have been tolerable , but " end of days " is simply a flaccid special effects show .  the cast is just as ineffective .  in his early scenes , gabriel byrne attempts to invest beelzebub with some panache , but he all too soon turns into just another standard issue monster .  kevin pollak comes and goes quickly , robin tunney comes off like a bargain basement winona ryder and as for arnold , well ? he's a better actor than casper van dien .  that should count for something .  way back in the aftermath " the exorcist " and " the omen , " supernatural swill like " end of days " might have passed muster as a b-movie .  but that was then and this is now .   " the x-files " and " buffy the vampire slayer " deliver real scares on a weekly basis and , if we want to see the devil , all we have to do is flip on " the 700 club " and take a gander at pat robertson's grinning maw .  after enduring " end of days , " all i can say is " get thee behind me , satan .  and while you're at it , get thee a better agent as well .

1 film adaptation of hunter s . thompson's infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title .  director terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5/10 ) )   " apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie " , according to gilliam .  plot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race .  during their trip , they systematically consume " two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls .  the movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use .  critique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer's own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess .  if you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels .  if , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture's entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) .  note : i have not read thompson's book .  having said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level .  this movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot .  it moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s . thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine .  it was 1971 , and the times were apparently " a' changing " in the states .  johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop .  during the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole .  i thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk .  the one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo .  i couldn't believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7 . 5/10 ) .  word on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible .  plenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others .  other than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed .  this movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream .  and for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind .  little known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine .  bill murray also portrayed a thompson-based character in the film where the buffalo roam .  johnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5/10 ) and what's eating gilbert grape ?   ( 7/10 ) .  in 1988 , depp told rolling stone magazine that he'd tried every drug by the age of 14 .  johnny hung out with some of the members of oasis while filming the uncompleted divine rapture in ireland , and later played some slide guitar on the 1997 album , be here now .  johnny was born in kentucky , is a high-school dropout , has nicknamed himself " mr . stench " , has been engaged to four women until now ( including actress winona ryder , whose " winona forever " tattoo had to be altered to " wino forever " after their breakup ) , currently plays guitar in a band called " p " , and owns the viper room nightclub in l . a .  
0  * this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films , director amy heckerling's latest , loser , seesaws between unpleasant and artificial , and is sometimes both at once .  when she tackles big issues , such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high , it's impossible to tell whether she's being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) , but whatever the case , she continually refuses to comment politically .  such is the sitcom tendency of her work : to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button .  this fear of drama soured me on fast times . . . , look who's talking , clueless , and now loser , in which ms . heckerling also demonstrates , for the first time , zero affinity for the milieu .  has anyone , for instance , ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvari's dora ?  attired in black thrift , her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips , she accepts the label of goth , but no self-respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging , as dora does , those geriatric rockers everclear , nor willingly went anywhere with a six-pack-wielding fratboy stranger .  the mechanics of loser's tired old introvert-boy-falls-for-extrovert-girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non-specificity , so that they become even less than stereotypes .  they become walking wardrobes .  small-town transplant paul ( a strangely static jason biggs ) , our eponymous hero , always wears his woolly hunter's cap with flaps covering the ears , and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn't scream " shemp " ( the lame stooge ) wig louder .  he has three smug-looking roommates ( the one-dimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers , but they share similar facial features , including and especially mouths ) , and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam .  though they're not overtly transvestites , heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy ; how very cruising of her .   ( the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged .  dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions .  unfortunately , either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated . )  when paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare , he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott ( superb greg kinnear ) .  although paul's already in love with dora by this point , as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name , he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott .  she's thrilled , but nevertheless spends a few days at paul's to recuperate ; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play ( " cabaret " ) , and just when paul's got in his head that she's starting to love him back in that non-friendly way , she decides to become alcott's live-in girlfriend .  cue precious hommage to the graduate , shots of paul drifting around berkeley--er . . .   ( aside : simon & garfunkel's " parsley , sage , rosemary & thyme " should never have been allowed in another motion picture . )  heckerling has a lot in common with nora " you've got mail " ephron , the only other prominent chick directing comedies today , in that neither has any use for strong-willed women .  men continue to trod on dora until the bitter end ( in the final scene , she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum ) , and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her will--mere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned , she's cheerily redecorating his apartment .   ( heckerling is so laissez-faire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the would-be rapists for jokey epilogue titles . )  goth veneer aside , there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora , and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them .  heckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model , and while such arcs may not be heckerling's social responsibility , it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes .   ( consider , too , that dora is the film's sole female principal . )  not that loser is worth contemplating this seriously--god knows heckerling didn't .  that is her hallmark .

1 as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film .  the shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars .  to see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film .  as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin .  the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous .  this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds .  it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film .   " in the heat of the night " was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america .  jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental .  in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers .  he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present .  preceding the very original " a soldier's story " and the recently released " the hurricane , " " in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters .  the film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted .  tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him .  as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist .  poitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character .  never nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing .  however , unlike " the hurricane " where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance .  as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role .  he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople .  he would refer to tibbs as " boy " and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him .  as the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff .  he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors .  what i really enjoyed about steiger's character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film .  he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil .  instead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future .  most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes .  this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day .  jewison's determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate .   " in the heat of the night " shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960's .  it displays this perfectly .  however , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest .  it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim .  there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) .  also , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered .  the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic .   ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson .  he managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , " in the heat of the night " and the even better " in cold blood . " )  
1 i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video .  it really scared me , and i didn't want to go see it .  however , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it .  i didn't get a chance to do so , until now .  the film , disney's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron .  it has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it .  then , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran .  taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' ( they have a pig named hen-wen ) .  one day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest .  an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location .  taran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her .  along the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen ) .  when he hears hen wen's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants .  taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king's castle from far away .  taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen .  he manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon .  there , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls .  along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie .  the three manage to escape the horned king's castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic .  as they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen's trail .  he leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks' , to a whirlpool .  suddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk .  taran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva .  he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world .  with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage .  it turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place .  when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword .  taran agrees , much to eilonwy's horror , but at least they get the black cauldron .  but ? the cauldron can't be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped .  the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive .  things take a turn for the worse when the horned king's henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle .  taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? ) .  just when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr .  taran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away .  gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay .  taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king .  he kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely .  taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king's castle just as it self-destructs .  the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain' .  in response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi .  the trade is made ; gurgi's seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group .  as taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all !  the happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return .  as spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times .  before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio .  bringing this book to the screen was the studio's fondest dream .  miller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects .  when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron .  by this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department .  many of the studio's old men had retired or died .  therefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film .  originally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped .  the film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied' from lloyd alexander's chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney's other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it .  in addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart' and `unmemorable' , compared to other disney animated features .  but whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million .  the failure of the film grounded the studio's animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio's reputation .  the next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn't do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) .  only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features .  as for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron .  finally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released .  because of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ?  the people who had seen the film didn't think so .  in fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it .  for a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom .  few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn't seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat .  but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) .  somewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! ' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states .  before that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs .  those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version .  even still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed .  some felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn't .  but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available .  as for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn't expect much at all .  in fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn't think the film would ever be such a good film .  much to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , " this is the same film everyone saw ?  the one that flopped at the box office ?  the one that critics and filmgoers alike called " a bad movie " ?  this doesn't seem like all of the above .  instead , it's a classic in its own right .  the film has a wonderful cast of characters .  there's taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig-keeper , the story's hero .  the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true .  he is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on .  there's a likeable character here !  not that he's the only likeable character in the film .  there's gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don't quite hit it off at first .  but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film's imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck .  the other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren't quite as well rounded as they should be .  the story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale .  elmer bernstein's music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner .  the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios .  even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch .  overall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor .  fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids .  there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney's other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg .  fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie .  even though it doesn't have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given .  that better chance has finally come .  whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney's most proudest achievements .  i can't help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ?  
0 miramax " disinvited " on-line media from press screenings of scream 3 .  they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled reviews and post them prior to the film's february 4th release date-unsound reasoning .  you see , 'net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals-miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on-line film critics society ( ofcs ) and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain't it cool news .  no , the ? mini major' was afraid we'd let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit , that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved ( by this writer , at least ) franchise .  something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get-go : cotton weary ( liev schrieber ) , the former lover and would-be killer of maureen prescott , sidney's mother , is juggling phone calls in his luxury car .   ( once considered a danger to society , weary now hosts his own talk show , " 100% cotton " , a clever , if dated , jab at american pop culture . )  of course , a new ghostface dials him up , and , with memories of scream's unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind , we immediately wonder , where is the killer ?  the backseat ?  the next car ?  thrilling prospects , to be sure , but actually , ghostface is at the weary residence , waiting for cotton's girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering .  what's missing from this sequence , and indeed scream 3's remaining frights ( most disappointingly , the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes , one of which might spring to life ) , is an elaborate and attenuated payoff .  our other surviving regulars have become estranged .  sidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks , while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2's movie-within-a-movie , " stab 3 " , and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program .  murder reunites them , as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of " stab 3 " , imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney's death .  the appeal of ghostface's villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend , your classmate , your next door neighbour . . . or a combination of people .  scream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery , with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next , but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive .  ironic self-reflection aside , parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there's at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume .  with scream 3 , the novelty of ghostface's ever-mutating identity has worn off some , but the character remains conceptually potent .  conceptually . the execution of ghostface's master plan this time around is creaky , because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we'd come to understand in scream and scream 2 . the movie gets in the silly habit of saying " all bets are off ! "  in reference to the " rules " of a trilogy's third act , but there's a difference between rule breaking and cheating .  with the departure of kevin williamson , who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 ( that , for reasons incomprehensible to me , was ignored , save the notion of " stab 3 " ) , kruger needed to be reined in tighter , and by wes craven .  craven's direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects .  how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies ) , akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny .  it pains me to write this , but scream 3's comedy is generally laughless , with the exception of well-timed performances by josh pais ( as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven's music of the heart ) , jamie kennedy ( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 ) , and parker posey ( through sheer force of will as a b-actress ) .  the visuals are much weaker in part three , as well-the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming's camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before .   ( aside : in the wake of columbine , craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3-why the sanctimony , when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? )  finally , marco beltrami's music cues the suspense too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it's mostly silent .  sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here , they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve-jangling score .  i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe , the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii-woefully out of synch with its prequels , scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish , and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs .  the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : ? part three must disappoint' .  
0 the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer's other comic book adaptation , batman and robin .  both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts , but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations .  in panel-sized morsels , implausible plots and " rambo " -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork , but on thirty foot silver screens , it's much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures .  spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) , then set on fire and left for dead .  though the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here's what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan's army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always ) .  he is renamed , for reasons unbeknownst , spawn , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon .  but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child , he realizes that he can't be the evil superdemon he's expected to be , and he sets about avenging his untimely death .  typical of summer blockbusters , spawn is an effects-laden ninety minute rock video .  while the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) , spawn's prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold .  but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( spawn longs for his wife , but they don't have a single scene together before simmons' death ! ) , conflict ( who will triumph is not anybody's guess ) , and believability ( not that i expected it ) .  so many questions are left unanswered , and i'm sure they won't be addressed in the inevitable sequel .  while last year's the crow : city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent ) , it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power .  spawn is an in-your-face , screaming banshee of a film ; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid , but they haven't the faintest idea how to make a movie .  
1 in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in .  we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves .  without an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye .  even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema .  but do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ?  exploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept .  is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ?  midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth .  as joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration .  during the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo . '  as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead . '  a troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone .  having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody .  joe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream .  he romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance .  by the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing .  just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success .  but how realistic are these ideals ?  joe had raped and been raped in texas .  the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas .  alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation .  the ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention .  schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny .  we understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame .  he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york .  in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself .  standing up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh .  schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation .  beyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison .  the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation .  it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men .  joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff . '  there are two predominant images of new york .  the first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty .  the other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth .  joe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter .  mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men .  joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions .  the people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity .  what has become of joe's american dream ?  schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party .  joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex .  at the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami .  contrasting joe's daily struggles , shots of warhol's crew display wanton indulgence .  there is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors .  the party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals .  joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils .  the american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent .  as joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him .  his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished .  for joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity .  tossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami .  the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window .  instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe .  reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus' window with joe hardly taking notice .  the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before .  the world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream .  no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means .  midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream .  there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family .  then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city .  joe's attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york .  during his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man .  an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck's progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons .  
1 with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different .  its structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books .  the parallels don't end there , either .  atlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king's dreamcatcher .  even the film's content is a bit reminiscent of mile .  in fact , it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile .  king's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film's title comes from the second chapter ) .  it's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son .  bobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich .  when a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror .  ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers .  i won't go into what these powers are , but they're considerably toned down from the book ( and don't involve black stuff flying out of ted's mouth , a la mile ) .  atlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel's final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years .  atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski's red .  the acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . lecter .  most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider .  while i didn't really have much of a problem with goldman's screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency .  goldman , for those of you who don't read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else's films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's penned ( like the general's daughter ) .  it's mean-spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o . j .  and robert blake ) .  in atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back .  well , he's not , and it doesn't make sense .  1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements  
0 forget get carter .  instead . . .  get me a cup of coffee .  what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ?  did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ?  when did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads .  the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don't mean new york city .  get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown .  stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up .  a few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey .  that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul .  stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past .  too bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges .  get carter is a simple story .  stallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) .  when frank's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented " carter's way " .  he talks tough with his brother's wife , lends a helping had to his brother's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee .  carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough .  carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties .  what a minute !  this sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey .  better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off .  actually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) .  while stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose .  throughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously .  his one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character .  there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words .  the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke .  an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character .  he may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book .  get carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud .  the only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting .  never mind that it should never have been made at all .  
0 what do you get when you rip-off good movies like woody allen's bananas and martin scorsese's after hours ?  you'd think you'd get the best of both films .  instead you get woo .  falling in somewhere between def jam's how to be a player ( which was awful ) and booty call ( which was ok ) , woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing african-americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons .  the whole film plays out as a black version of after hours , as wild woman woo ( jada pinkett smith ) goes out on a blind date with straight-laced tim ( tommy davidson ) .  mayhem follows them .  for some unknown reason ( read : contrived screenplay ) davidson puts up with all of woo's antics for the entire night , which include her destroying his bathroom mirror , stealing things from his house , violently questioning him ( accusing and belittling him actually ) about previous girlfriends , causing a riot in an elegant restaurant , and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldn't tolerate .  but for the sake of this bad movie ?  sure , why not ?  there are a few chuckles in the film , the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas .  in this case , davidson is running from thugs , gets into a subway car as the doors are closing , starts to taunt the thugs , then the doors open back up again .  a good joke , but a stolen one .  another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams' cameo as himself .  movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so , and not one of them has ever been a hit .  woo won't be one either .  so why was it made ?  and more importantly , isn't there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive ?  everyone involved should really reconsider their careers at this point .

0 guilt . guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time ; the penultimate t & a thriller , basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living .  but i know so well that it's a terrible film , made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt .  verhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and , on november seventh , 1997 , unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me , who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies .  the pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year .  a simple , white on black title card reads " starship troopers " -my friends and i speculated that the night before the prints were shipped , verhoeven realized he forgot the credits .  is this how a hundred million dollar movie should open ?  were the rest of the film that subdued . . .  starship troopers is about a group of white , blond-haired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names .  they graduate high school , join the military , and then , rather curiously , decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet .  the story is so incomprehensible , and told so bombastically , it's akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue .   ( aside , club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasn't changed in the future . )  one plus : starship troopers contains some very funny sequences , specifically the newsreels of the future .  hysterically funny , actually .  but the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between .  the storytelling lacks focus , to say the least .  the politics of the film are scary .  the actions of the major female characters are dictated by their out-of-control libidos .  there's even a creepy sex scene : the lovely dina meyer makes out , nude , with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater , just the way he seems to like it .  i use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor i've encountered in a big budget picture ; all chiseled features and machismo , he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders .  of course , verhoeven's probably the one to blame , and perhaps i'm jealous because i'm so disgusting .  at any rate , a movie called starship troopers shouldn't be about sex .  exactly ten years ago , verhoeven made robocop , which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving .  and r-rated , despite its goofy premise .  maybe it's asking too much for verhoeven to make a pg-movie , then-he's a master of insipid violence .  however , ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it .  
1 the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call " the reality check movie series " , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz .  all three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what isn't , and if our world is just a huge game .  the thirteenth floor doesn't reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it .  in the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus .  in existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game .  in the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices .  there is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated .  the thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i didn't expect it to take , and i'm not very sure it was such a great turn to make .  rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film , the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds .  after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller , played by armin mueller-stahl , douglas hall , played by craig bierko , a man that worked under fuller for many years , must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using , to the year 1937 , which consists of computer generated characters only .  the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days .  all of the people involved are just characters , or are they ?  douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours , and killed fuller .  along the way , douglas interacts with many different potential suspects , and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller , jane fuller , played wonderfully by a talented young actress , gretchen mol .  the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going , and doesn't use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer's interests .  i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz , and i wouldn't enjoy it , but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film .  unfortunately , many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content , letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened .  the scenes that aren't original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere , leaving you wondering , " what is the point of this ? "  sometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true .  i know this isn't a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is .  on the plus side of acting , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller-stahl .  in the thirteenth floor , he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances .  another plus is gretchen mol's realistic performance , creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one-dimensional phase .  don't expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor , just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile , and shuts you down like any other movie would .  thrills , chills , and spills aren't what you will get in this film , but you will just get another trip to send your mind on , scrambling it until you've had enough .  the bottom line- let's hope this is the last of the " reality check " based movies for awhile .  
0 the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole . . .  and , in the future , it's also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole .  naturally , this is the setup for the other event horizon . . .  the movie .  when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at , just outside of neptune , the crew of the ship called the " lewis and clark " has to go to investigate , and dr . william weir , the creator of the " event horizon , " gets to come along for the ride .  if you've glanced at a poster for this movie , you know that , supposedly , what follows is " infinite terror . "  well , i don't know about the " terror " part , but " infinite " certainly seems to qualify . . .  event horizon is a mean-spirited , gory , sick excuse for a film .  it starts off as an alien rip-off , and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes .  at least for those first 40 minutes it's an * interesting * rip-off of alien .  that's a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie , which seems to go on forever .  it not a scary monster movie , nor is it a psychological thriller .  it is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore .  you've seen this kind of movie before .  the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility .  this is a kind of movie for which i have no respect , a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago .  it is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore , but event horizon takes the low road , and the viewers pay the price .  there are many good , respectable performances , from fishburne and neill most noticably .  paul anderson's direction is impressive , as it was in mortal kombat .  there are many nice special effects , mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero-gravity .  the sets are beautiful to gaze upon .  and richard t . jones' character ( cooper ) is hilarious and extremely likable ( more so than most characters i've seen in recent movies ) for the little screen time that he has .  and none of this can save the movie from being a d-grade level of film .  the idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls , a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers , is a promising one .  a haunted house story in space isn't such a bad idea .  but the final execution is extremely disappointing .  that's not to say that philip eisner ( here making his feature film-writing debut ) doesn't have talent .  for those first 40 minutes , he manages to make a tired premise interesting , adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip-off story , and that's something that not too many writers can do .  he even has one scene that , though it also tries to sicken the audience , has a honestly tense feel to it ( the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space ) .  he definitely has something of a gift , but it's not fully on display here .  i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him , and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise .  but because of what this movie degenerates into , i have little or no respect , and got little or no enjoyment , out of it .  if this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film , then i agree with laurence fishburne's sentiment - " god help us . "  
0  " gordy " is not a movie , it is a 90-minute-long " sesame street " skit , and a very bad one at that .  this movie is so stupid and dumb that it's depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light , and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie .  i'm sure children are the target audience of this movie , but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it .  it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy ( voiced by garms ) , whose family has been taken away to " up north , " which we know means death .  of course we can hear the animals talk to each other , and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible .  actually , it's almost funny in a way .  the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears , a little girl named jinnie sue macallister ( young ) who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him .  jinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it .  what is the point of this ?  maybe she is one of the producer's relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something .  we then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce ( roescher ) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating .  he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue , but he accidentally falls in a pool ( probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a $200 suit on - nah , didn't see that one coming ! ) ,  starts to drown , and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him .  if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hank's grandfather , the original ceo , dies and leaves his fortune to hank . . .  and gordy !  of course there must be a villain , but even this villain ( donadio as sipes ) isn't that evil .  he never raises his voice or becomes angry , and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story .  it's hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film , or if the filmmaker's are just this untalented and stupid .  at times " gordy " is tolerable to watch , thus earning it one star and not the dreaded " z- . "  but it's just so unbelievably boring , cliche , dumb , unfunny , corny , and just plain bad it may scare children , it certainly disturbed me .

0 based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad , victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers , heyst ( william dafoe ) and alma ( irene jacob ) , who seek refuge on heyst's isolated island .  however , their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones ( sam neil ) , martin ricardo ( rufus sewell ) and their servant , pedro ( graziano marcelli ) , who have come to steal heyst's rumoured plunder .  while the novel is largely complex in characterization , the film sadly transposes conrad's characters into lacklustre leads , the most disappointing being heyst himself .  conrad's heyst adheres religiously to his late father's ways of detachment and isolation .  his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice .  the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe's ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst .  without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst's character , all that is left of conrad's main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement .  on the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe's flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism .  in the end , we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another .  the final transformation , while perceptible , lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad's novel .  its absence in the film is unforgivable .  the film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers .  alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship , namely heyst's underlying philosophy of detachment , which heyst himself grapples with .  the struggle against heyst's ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma's love for him .  jacob , fair-skinned , gentle and yet passionate , handles the role with precision , detailing nuances where possible .  unfortunately , she is let down by a superficial script .  the couple's relationship develops too hastily , leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant show-and-tell approach .  all we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone .  this is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions .  the sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe's american accent ( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london ) .  the other characters such as schomberg ( jean yanne ) , the owner of a hotel , and mr jones ( sam neill ) , also fall short of conrad's meticulous characterization .  while schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive , mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma .  sam neil's caricature of a slightly stout , effeminate and soft-spoken gentleman-at-large nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as " an insolent spectre on leave from hades , endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror " .  poor characterization aside , kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo , secretary to mr jones , a reckless ruffian capable of murder .  sewell , with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes , becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity , masterminding deceitful plans behind jones' back .  at the same time , we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans .  despite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer , very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film has ended .  sourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have their charm , but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic , which is what victory deserves to be .  the delicately inter-woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate production .  at the end of the film , we are told that perhaps alma's victory was in teaching heyst how to love .  a hollow victory indeed .  the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  
0 renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star's 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller .  tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances .  writer steven e . desouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as outre as _double_team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little .  van damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u . s . --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans .  it's all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . .   . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ .  while all of van damme's films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting " skills " of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme's embarrassing directorial effort , 1996's _the_quest_ ) .  a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : " i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! "  and " entrepreneurship , babycakes ! "  standing out among my favorites .  but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_'s laughs .  van damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual .  early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus's business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way .  even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug .  paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider's cia superior ; and lela rochon , playing an investigator for the jeans company , spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode .  in rochon's defense , though , her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs , exquisite bone structure , and perky bosoms , the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage .  tsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ , juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work .  here , though , tsui's visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill , coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise .  for each nifty trick tsui pulls off , such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices , there are others that are completely superfluous .  this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context .  for instance , one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box .  as he puts his hand in , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen .  it's undoubtedly an interesting visual , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something .  the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences , but surprisingly , those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired .  tsui does what he can to make something of them , employing freeze frames , blurred motion , and unconventional camera angles , but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza .  there isn't anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ , let alone anything remotely close to tsui's legendary hong kong works ( but that's a given going in ) .  if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo's stateside success , he would do best to break free from van damme . . .  before it's too late .  if he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_ , the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish . . .  that is , if it hasn't already disappeared entirely after this fiasco .  
0 you don't need to have seen the original " species " to appreciate how utterly lousy " species ii " is .  with few exceptions , sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them , but the fact that " species ii " is a follow-up isn't the only reason it's so miserable .  it's the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction .  the plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle .  the slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black .  that should have been the end of the movie right there .  back on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you'll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate .  on a parallel track , government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film ( now called eve , again " played " by natasha henstridge ) and are keeping her around for some testing .  this , apparently , includes observing eve's reaction to " the dukes of hazzard " tv show , which she appears to enjoy .  eve's bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk " mates , " which we are forced to witness in gross-out detail , but otherwise there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let's hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only ) .  eve finally breaks free of her confines--and her bra--for the finale , but the effects are so messy you can't really see what's going on .  peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams " i told 'em not to go ! "  at the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle .  michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox ( so that he can enter high security areas , flash a badge and claim to be press , maybe ? ) , as does marg helgenberger as dr . laura baker , the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns .  they're both unbelievably wooden .  what's a talented filmmaker like peter medak ( " the ruling class , " " the krays , " " let him have it " ) doing directing this tripe , i wonder .  it's an unfortunate trend , this : once-talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like " species ii . "  last year peter hyams gave us " the relic " ; no thanks necessary there .  and the first " species " was helmed by roger donaldson who , although certainly no genius behind the camera , had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects .  is it just that there are no better offers out there ?   " species ii " is worthless .  worse than that , it's also exploitative , offensive , and insulting to the intelligence at every turn .  it's not that there isn't anything positive to say about the film .  there is .  after 92 minutes , it ends .  
0 perhaps if the impostors didn't have so much going for it , it wouldn't have been such a tremendous disappointment .  written , directed , and produced by one of its two stars , stanley tucci , whose last picture was the indie smash hit , big night , the impostors almost never catches fire .  sputtering like a two-day old campfire , the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed .  the film's other star , oliver platt , was hilarious as the senator's aide in bulworth .  the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent , including woody allen , steve buscemi , hope davis , alfred molina , campbell scott , lili taylor and tony shalhoub .  all are wasted save allen , who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes .   ( the audience will easily identify with allen's sentiments . )  with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged subtitles , the movie engenders little genuine laughter .  the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it .  the plot for the movie involves two starving actors , maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci ) , who accidentally end up on a cruise ship .  in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor ( alfred molina ) , who is chasing them , they dress up as ship's stewards .  the over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer .  when the leads hide from their pursuers , arthur covers maurice's mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze .  at other times , we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else , while darting in and out of staterooms .  with the film's chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage , it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce .  the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having .  too bad they weren't more concerned with the audience's potential enjoyment .  the jokes , frequently framed in silence , fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground .  one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film's dailies .  surely , if they had , they would have realized what leaden results they were producing .  it is tricky having good actors play bad ones , but , if they couldn't pull it off , they should have just given up .   " the show is over for this fella , " steve buscemi's character says towards the end .  the mystery is why they didn't all give up in the beginning .  there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast .  the impostors runs 1 : 42 .  it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .  
1 star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 )  review by matt pusateri  few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars .  the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture .  arguably , more americans today can explain what " the force " or a " jedi " is than a budget deficit or a serb .  so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ?  can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ?  against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week .  and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment .  while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking .  it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films .  the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films .  as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) .  the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation .  the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) .  later , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice .  on tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts .  qui-gon senses the child is " unusually strong " with the force and begins to suspect that he may be " the one " prophesized to " bring balance to the force . "  as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader .  complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala .  while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul .  if the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is .  the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy .  but the complexity is not overwhelming .  the story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode .  one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused .  it's unclear whose story phantom menace is .  in the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight .  but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's .  if this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation .  lloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive .  on screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is " the one . "  the rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas .  neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight .  mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility .  portman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality .  the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them .  individually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series .  but unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another .  in star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke .  the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities .  in the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other .  there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other .  individually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them .  this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers .  but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging .  many of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining .  first , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates .  the characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing " destroyers " on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council .  each location is elaborate and complex .  lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines .  most of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren't possible when the films were made .  more than ever , in this new film , lucas' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters .  the best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves .  watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room .  of all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable .  speaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks .  with more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy .  jar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon's accidental sidekick .  jar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble .  the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors .  however , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn't completely convincing .  he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene .  throughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a " roger rabbit " -like presence .  you accept that he's there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character .  initially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film .  on my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn't mind him at all .  a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates .  despite all the film's struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one's destiny and " the force , " like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously .  fortunately , lucas hasn't lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art .  from the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film's thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t .  in the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed .  and finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action .  from beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil .  the pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed .  the phantom menace won't win any major oscars .  it probably won't beat titanic's box office record .  and it's not even the best star wars film ( i'd put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) .  but it's an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster .  the film can't live up to it's hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that .  but it's still worth seeing . . .  probably more than once .  
1 i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night .  i went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success : personal growth and insightful humor about life .  i came away somewhat disappointed in this regard , getting some of the latter and not much of the former .  the basic plot revolves around billy crystal , who plays mitch robbins , turning forty .  he's now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original .  he's given a job at the radio station to his best friend , played by daniel stern , out of sympathy while stern's character works through his divorce .  his loser younger brother ( john lovitz ) comes to mitch's house to bum a money and place to live , all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday .  during the celebration , mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curly's ( the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance ) old hat .  after a business trip to las vegas , crystal , stern , and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure .  on the way , they run into curly's twin brother , duke , played by ( you know who ) jack palance .  first of all , the cinematography was beautifully done , especially the outdoor scenes in the desert .  the scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself .  there is some character development during the film .  the actors remain true to their characters and play them well , without overplaying the jokes .  the movie is a good basic adventure , with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict .  the movie is paced well , but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end .  humor-wise , the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film .  there are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake , but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel ( surprise , surprise for a sequel , right ? ) .  however , the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film's manipulation of the audience .  the film tries to pull your heart-strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other , like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend's butt .  this is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original .  there were also some parts which appeared unrealistic , like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn't worry more about water while tromping around the desert .  some strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here .  since the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich ( unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original ) , i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey .  overall , i'd say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some story-line deficiencies making it less worthy than the original .  it may be worth the full price of admission , but a matinee would be a better bargain .  
0 in the first death wish movie , mild-mannered new york architect paul kersey , played by charles bronson , was avenging the death of his wife .  in the second , he was avenging his daughter .  in the third , he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend .  fourth movie , on the other hand , begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen , played by kay lenz .  however , since this is death wish movie , we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for .  this time karen's teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways .  kersey's new targets , unlike the previous movies , aren't the ordinary street punks but rich , heavily armed and well-connected drug dealers .  even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support , and it comes from the publisher nathan white ( john p . ryan ) , determined to avenge the drug-related death of his own daughter .  white's plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them .  the plan begins to take shape , but kersey's actions bring attention of two police detectives - reiner ( george dickerson ) and nozaki ( soon teck-oh ) .  fourth ( and , unfortunately , not the final ) installment in the death wish series , will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group , production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade .  however , although some critics might argue , death wish 4 : the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3 . paul kersey , one of the most intriguing ( and potentially controversial ) characters of the 1970s , is still being dumbed down by mediocre script , and charles bronson really doesn't feel the need to put much effort in his acting .  however , the hand of a veteran director j . lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner's and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal , although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring .  there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence , and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end .  the script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused kay lenz's character ) and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years .  there are even some half-hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and unintentional , like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson's 1970s classics .   ( special note to x-philes : mith pilleggi , the actor who plays ad skinner in the x- files , could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman ) .  
1 in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america .  this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was .  she was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was .  finally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not .  to get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life's savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson .  jack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time .  rose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping .  thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy . . .  this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia .  the movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly .  now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story .  it serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating .  this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough .  the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective .  movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency .  the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable .  the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie .  part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast .  the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired .  the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles .  looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie .  the casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is .  one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself .  yes , you read correctly , the ship is a character .  how is the titanic a character ?  you ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you .  this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this .  mr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense .  all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp .  now , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards .  the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking .  in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) .  the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique .  the movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship .  the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes .  now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end .  the historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done .  the method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less .  regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at .  the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing .  if you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! !  it might not be the best movie in the world . .  but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it .  during none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie .  
1 deep rising is one of " those " movies .  the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us .  it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god . . . screw that , it says boldly , let's see some computer generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors .  heh !  them wacky monsters , gotta love 'em .  of course , since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story , hollywood must give that little extra " oumph " to get people in theaters .  that is where deep rising fails , which is a good thing .  confused ?  let me explain :  despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , deep rising is still , at heart , a good 'ol b movie .  luckily , it's a very good b movie .  the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie's bread and butter .  therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre .  of course we know there's a big slimy creature behind that door , that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive .  we just don't know when or how horrible it will be .  i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high .  imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually , well , pretty darn funny at times .  a funny b movie ?  well , that's new .  these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh .   ( except for a few unintended laughs once a while . )  and before you know it , treat williams , wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen .  hey ! i know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies .  cool .  familiar faces .  so far so good .  our man treat is the hero , he'll live .  wes is a staple of b movies , he is the token victim .  we know he'll buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out .  famke is the babe , 'nuff said .  there is also a guy with glasses ( the guy with glasses always dies ) a black person ( b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies , never fails ) and a very funny , nerdy guy .   ( ah !  comic relief .  how can we possibly explain having to kill him . . . let  him live . )  after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home .  i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew .   ( please kill me . )  suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times , went " ewwww " about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing .  i'm a man , we nottice these things .  all in all , i'd recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain at the door . . . but  bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you .  the acting is decent , the effects top rate .  how to best describe it ?  put together the jet ski scene from hard rain , the bug attacks from starship troopers , a couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming " don't go there , he's behind you " and you end up with deep rising .  for creepy crawly goodness , tight t-shirts , major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water .  
0  " spawn " may be somewhat of an older film .  in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn't seen it will finally get to see it ( that is , if they see it ) .  but i managed to catch it before it made it's way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and , god forbid , video cassette purchasing .  it wasn't the worst film of year by any means .  it isn't even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year .  but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten , which , in simpler terms , means it comes in at number 6 on my " worst of 1997 " list .  the only reason it doesn't come in lower is thanks to the special effects , which might actually have been some of the best of the year .  performances , however , were either wooden or , for the most part , unforgivingly campy .  in fact , this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness !  even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality .  i don't know how to explain that one ; it wasn't exactly choppy , but something about it seemed .   .   .  well , annoyingly unprofessional .  john leguizamo almost makes it as clown , but not quite .  he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional .  but the main problem i found with " spawn " , as with most films that wind up on my " worst of " lists , is that it was just plain boring .  i wouldn't even say there was a climax to the film .  sure , it had the big battle scene at the end , but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion .  never too soon , the movie did conclude in a very simple , disappointing way .  even though it's one of the shorter movies i've seen this year , it's one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again .  like i said , the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride , no matter how small .  i was impressed with the opening sequence , so long as i didn't allow the melodramatic voice-over and lobotomizing editing to get to me .  and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn's outfit created .  but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes , which looked quite a bit like a modern video game .  who knows if " spawn : the video game " wasn't part of the plan from the beginning ?  keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable , and in a very small amount , makes up for the cheeziness of it all .  but none of this movie's saving graces can it make it something i'd recommend seeing , no matter what the price of admission .  this movie is definitely not for young children , which shouldn't really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers , if anyone , would likely find it appealing .  if you really want to catch a movie , there are many better ones out there , no matter what your tastes might be !  trust me !   " spawn " has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers !  
1 there was a lot riding on this movie .  everyone even moderately interested in the " scream " series was dying to know how it would end .  what would be the " final act " ?  this is the end of an era for them , a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet , talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies , and , for kids under 17 , those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into " scream " while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves .  no need to worry ; " scream 3 " is endlessly inventive and entertaining , a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name , reinvented the horror genre , and continued in the self-referential , post-modern tradition of quentin and co .  so , how does the story go ?  as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe , sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , now all-grown-up and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche , is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress , but rather in upstate california , living , understandably , alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems .  she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone .  but that ? ? ? s not where the movie starts off .  instead , in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar , and conceptually horrifying , sequence in " eye for an eye " ( 1995 ) , cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , now a big star , drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls , demands the location of sidney ? ? ? s home , and , when he doesn ? ? ? t get it , threatens the life of cotton ? ? ? s girlfriend christine , and cotton can ? ? ? t do anything to stop him .  the rest of the sequence is particularly clever , setting up a constant throughout the picture : the killer has a high-tech electronic voice-changer that tops that of the first two .  not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice-over artist roger jackson ( ha , ha ) , he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters , including sidney , and the returned gale weathers ( courtney cox arquette ) and dewey riley ( david arquette ) .  at the same time , stab 3 , the third film-within-a-film based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college , has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro ; whereas the account of the first two films was true , the franchise within " scream " has now become totally fictional .  nevertheless , we learn , cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production , as himself to be killed off in the first scene .  so , it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie ? ? 'either the actor portraying them , or the real thing .  sometimes both .  clever , indeed .  but , who goes next ?  no one knows .  three different scripts were penned , we ? ? ? re told , to keep the true finale off the internet ( a nod to the " scream " 2 fiasco a few years back ) and no one knows for sure which one the killer read .  still , all the while sidney stays concealed in her home , only visiting dad for the first half-hour of the film , while also having horrifying visions of her mother , which takes us back a bit to sidney ? ? ? s fear of becoming what her mother was ? ? 'or , at least , what her mother was secretly .  when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent , she ? ? ? s chased onto the set of stab 3 , wandering through " woodsboro , " written and directed as an odd , surreal , nightmare indeed , this is one of " scream 3 " ? ? ? s finest moments .  okay , over the years , i ? ? ? ll admit that i ? ? ? ve become quite the " scream " fan .  no , i don ? ? ? t have the ghostface costume or the director ? ? ? s cut laserdisc , but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo , and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films ( yes , i said " dramatic element " ) , sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with " scream " .  throughout the film , though , i noticed a much more subtle approach than the other two films .  granted that there ? ? ? s stabbin-a-plenty going on throughout , but there ? ? ? s considerably less blood , less gore .  honestly , i like this approach .  it ? ? ? s more classical , more rebellious , constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven .  he knows when to hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze with energy , illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience .  some critics have noted that " scream 3 " seems to take itself more seriously this time ; maybe so , or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger ( arlington road ) , who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts , saw an opportunity for true irony ? ? 'maybe even a little bit of satire ? ? 'if the film worked in a few more clich ? ? s .  what puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film , i ? ? ? m afraid , is the ending , or , rather , the identity of the killer .  it does the job , i guess , accomplishes what it should , bringing the three films full circle , but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived , too arbitrary ; after a second viewing , which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation , the killer ? ? ? s identity still seems a little too random , but his motivation came across more sound this time around , and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying .  all in all , " scream 3 " does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy : it is not the worst of the films .  as a trilogy , " scream " was a lot of fun ; refreshing , humorous , offbeat .  almost sad to see it go .  but then , it does seem best to quit while you ? ? ? re ahead , and " scream 3 " does a fine job of providing closure to its characters .  for now , " scream " holds the title as the finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid .  not too shabby .  
0 capsule : one of the ten worst movies ever made .  christopher lambert vs . evil ninjas in modern-day japan . . .  and nobody wins .  the hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain-damaged that i could almost feel affection for it .  i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it weren't also insanely xenophobic and insulting .  christopher lambert plays a computer-parts salesman who's on business in japan .  he meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) .  apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered .  since lambert is a witness , he's of course the next one to die .  let's stop and think about this for a second .  if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he'd have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock .  in this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him .  i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body .  you know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is .  this is , of course , only the beginning of the movie's problems .  lambert eventually finds pseudo-safety with a long-haired modern-day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun .  they are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows .  the script doesn't know what the hell to do with them .  lone , as the bad guy , is zero-dimensional .  the only bad-guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him .  in the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype .  what's funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there's a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful .  also , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it's been designed to accompany .  there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re-couple the whole thing with the movie's relentlessly stupid plot .  by the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham-handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no longer care .  we're not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies !  someone once said that the key to good art -- good movies , good books , whatever -- is to start somewhere interesting , end up somewhere interesting , and show respect for the audience all along the way .  this movie bungles two out of three , badly .  
0 woody allen is one of the most successful artist-directors in hollywood , but he is becoming less and less reliable as a filmmaker .  in his early years of film-making he mastered the simple comedy .  from there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles .  some of these work better than others .  zelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist .  deconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back .  harry block ( allen ) has in his life only two drives .  he wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing .  the story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments .  perhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harry's life by editing harry's scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out .  as a writer , harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises .  the film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harry's books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harry's life .  these fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion , but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters .  it is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person .  if that sounds complicated , it is .  then as another device in one of the stories , an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image .  harry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time .  as if these touches did not create sufficient confusion , the story is told out of chronological order .  if allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding , any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable .  but allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand .  deconstructing harry is set at a time when harry's old college , the one that expelled him when he attended it , wants now to honor him for a lifetime of writing achievement .  harry is searching among his friends to find one who will go with him .  just why someone who is so unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear .  harry tries his current girl friend fay ( elizabeth shue ) only to find that she is about to marry harry's old friend larry ( billy crystal ) .  block would like his son hilly ( eric lloyd ) to accompany him , but hilly's mother , previously first harry's psychiatrist and more recently his wife , refuses to let her son see his father .  another friend richard ( bob balaban ) would go but has health problems .  harry also considers bringing a prostitute cookie ( hazel goodman ) .  it is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite , but cookie is considerably different--black and a lot brighter than mira sorvino's character in the previous film .  while the comedy sequences are never complete , a few are elaborate and some quite funny .  the centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell with allen playing a sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil , who looks a lot like larry .  that story also is left uncompleted , perhaps to show harry's unwillingness to commit even to telling a story .  the linchpin that was needed to tie together the stylistic quirks of this film was a central character who changes and who gives us something about which to care .  that character is patently not the one allen creates in harry block and not the characters around harry as seen through his acerbic eyes .  allen can do much better than deconstructing harry .  i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale .  
0 the most interesting part of " can't hardly wait " just happens to be not only the most human , but for many of us , the one part that many of us can easily relate to .  that is the character of denise ( lauren ambrose ) , the film's sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film , and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored .  the film wisely holds over this moment , nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party . . . almost  too nicely .  for some members of the audience ( read : me ) , this is basically a mirror of what's going on with them watching this film .  we sit there wondering why we've even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place .  i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this .  after all , this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with .  everyone's here : the jock , the homecoming queen , the nerd ( and his dominions of trekkies and x-philes ) , the alienated wannabe writer , the school spirit girl , the pothead ( s ) , the wigger , etc , etc , etc , and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial , lame , and basically as a bunch of losers .  except for denise , who rolls her eyes at everything , and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks ( her yearbook entry , something which is done for each main character , quotes oscar wilde - definite pointers there ) .  unfortunately , the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film .  the film , as i said , portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything .  however , instead of sticking with this , perhaps even going a bit further with it , they let this lie , and actually make these characters into our heroes .  we follow several of them , all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism , and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and/or identified with them .  and if we did , we certainly don't want to revisit that state of being .  here's a quick low-down : it's graduation , and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night , otherwise known as the " american grafitti " or , to a lesser extent , the " dazed and confused " cliche .  the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly ; the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party .   " can't hardly wait " just opts for a big indoor keg party , and a little bit of aimless driving , albeit of the i'm-whining-because-i-can't-get-a-girl-i-want brand .  we follow many people around , but mostly we trail preston ( ethan embry , of " that thing you do ! " ) , the alienated writer , who's been pining over the homcoming queen , amanda ( the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt ) , for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart .  now that she's broken up with her football player boyfriend , mike ( peter facinelli ) , he decides to go to the party with a note he's written declaring his " love " for her in the hopes he'll build up the guts to give it to her . . . even  though he's leaving for a multi-week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut ( okay : the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson ? ) .  since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn't be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film , and because it's a party , there are some more main characters , such as : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing after " dick tracy " ) , the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike , who's humiliated him for years , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise , the only exceptional character , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( don't ask ) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile .  ugh .  the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not " american grafitti " or " dazed and confused , " two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not to mention were extremely entertaining ) , but to john hughes films of the 80s , most notably " sixteen candles . "  the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters , and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion .  this film forgets to satirize its characters , and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes . . . and  then says that it's all okay .  we can't take this film seriously , nor can we take this as fun , so really what good is it ?  but i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction , except for a couple too-over-the-top features , like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it's like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities .  generally , though , elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement , and even manage to capture an altman-esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to really be admirable ) .  i actually did like seth green , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in " radio days " ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable . . . almost .  and , of course , lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise , the one character we could have used some more of , even though it would have changed the entirety of the film .  however , the character of denise really doesn't work with the film , when really thought about .  she's far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenever she appears , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone .  she's not just the cynic or the intellectual ; she's just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters .  she may ruin the film more , but at least when she's on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves " well , at least we'll be entertained . "  a couple other things that just don't work : mike's character , who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general ; the aimless , bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhaps the one thing that just doesn't work at all : jenna eflman's uncredited cameo as an angel - just didn't work , but nice try .  basically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i'm giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we'd do .  we don't feel for these characters because for most of us , we aren't stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots .  the acid test for high school movies is : does it at all capture the feel of what it's portraying ?  the answer for this film is no .  nice try , though .  
0 i'm really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone .  sure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god's green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out .  the crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff .  hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in .  clueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time .  and people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i'm the only one who doesn't like it .  one girl said if i'd seen the movie with " an open mind , " i would have enjoyed it .  nothing could be further from the truth .  i went into the theater expecting to love the movie .  the preview looked good and of course i'm crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters .  almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way .  when we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn't me ) yelled out , " that was the worst f$&#in' movie i've ever seen " and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement .  so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia's pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter .  i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i'll probably never understand made me rent it anyway .  what i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever .  and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like .  where to begin in criticizing this movie ?  the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she's still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever .  there is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence .  zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero .  so why does this movie get one star out of me ?  well , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub .  and if it wasn't bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get .  alicia plays a babysitter who's spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party .  and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) .  as the movie trods along , we discover she's not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character's fantasies ( and probably every male viewer's too ) .  the drunken father thinks she's just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she's taking her bubble bath .  they even throw in the middle aged wife's fantasies about a male counterpart at the party .  not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy .  at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated .  in fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there's absolutely no nudity in it .  so you can't call it a sex flick .  i've already pointed out that it can't fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ?  bad .  
1 the most amazing thing about paul cox's innocence is how unlike a movie it is .  i mean that as the highest compliment .  if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i'd want to run and hide .  the sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence .  along with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable .  the romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles " bud " tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby .  they decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair .  complicating matters is andreas' frail health , and claire's longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can't understand why he's suddenly become obsolete .  in my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved .  john , claire's husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong .  claire initially insists she's a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her .  andreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence .  cox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train .  it's a reminder of andreas and claire's past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed .  a pall is cast on the whole affair .  a master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments .  in andreas' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire's love .  we also get glimpses into john and claire's relationship .  during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could .  all that's heard is the scraping of forks against plates .  the characters are unlike anything i've seen -- they're people .  so many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky .  or they're reduced to comedic buffoons .  ordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren't sure what the next step is .  they do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they've known throughout their adult lives .  bravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire's affair is automatically justified .  norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire's love difficult to accept .  we feel for him .  he's a decent man .  sure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now .  with so much presented to the audience , it's only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does .  however , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ? lan isn't likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon .  
0 _soldier_ is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn't have jean claude van damme in it .  i could liken it to the sci-fi cheese that was the hollywood product-of-choice back in the early 80s , but that would be too much of a compliment .  if there is a movie theater in hell , this film is playing there 24 hours a day .  the story , such that there is , revolves around todd ( kurt russell ) , an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not-too-distant ultra-conservative future ( is there any other kind ? )  after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him , todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy .  who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed , but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesn't matter , because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys .  after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash -- yes folks , there's more -- we see todd as a buff , scarred adult , now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat .  there's a new wrinkle , though .  todd and his brethren are declared obsolete , and a new batch of soldiers takes their place .  after losing a sanctioned battle with _dragon_'s jason scott lee , the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice-cube tray ( well , that's what is looked like ) on a remote garbage planet .  if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet , and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them , you're way ahead of the game .  the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half-expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute .  it's surprising that _soldier_ is the brain-child of _blade runner_ co-writer david webb peoples .  unlike that mind-twisting classic , this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double-spaced pages .  add into the mix the _mortal kombat_'s paul anderson inept direction , and it's easy to see how _soldier_ turned out so bad .  and the special effects !  remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars ?  gary busey is in this movie .  'nuff said .  _soldier_ is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults .  that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all .  now if you'll excuse me , i have to go weep for the future .  
0 capsule : godawful " comedy " that's amazingly shabby and cut-rate , and rather bereft of laughs .  i was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers : international man of mystery .  i desperately needed something to cheer me up , or at least distract me so i could get a clear head .  get some perspective .  even dumb movies can do that for me , sometimes .  i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment , but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery .  michael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a five-minute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film , padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of props-strategically-positioned-between-naked-actors-and-camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago .  the plot , what little there is of it : back in the swinging mod hep sixties ( i don't think i'm doing a disservice to the movie's attempted early look and feel by describing it that way ) , sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr . evil .  evil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later , when powers was out of the picture .  powers also had himself frozen , and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with .  the basic gag , that of powers' total inability to cope with the nineties , is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with .  the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics : james bond gags ( of which this movie has no end , right down to the silly character names ) , inept slapstick , toilet humor , and strategically placed props . . .  the movie's amazingly bereft of ideas , come to think of it , with a couple of bright exceptions .  one is dr . evil's son -- there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group , chaired by carrie fisher -- and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch ( it's a visual gag -- hard to describe , and hard to recommend seeing the movie for ) .  a lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie , but it's desperate rather than clever .  instead of skewering the whole thing , it's a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute .  myers himself is also desperate : he's given an idea to play , not a character .  plus , the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy ( albeit " nineties " ) agent are a waste of time .  i wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her , only to have her deck him one .  with a couple of exceptions , the movie misses all of its own best moments .  the movie even looks cheesy , and not in a good way : i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hi-def video or something , so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes .  the whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap .  my definition of comedy is simply : did it make me laugh ?  the few times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spent cringing and wanting out .  the most damning thing i could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson's shorts and sent it sailing .  
0 capsule : a wild jungle woman and an 11-story gorilla are discovered in tibet and taken to hong kong where the gorilla escapes and causes havoc .  this is a laughable 1977 rip off of king kong ( 1976 ) , itself a rip-off .  production values are low and audiences seem to like the film mostly for derisive laughter .   , high -2 ( -4 to +4 )  - directed by ho meng-hua .  - this film is provided to be a sort of laughing stock to finish the festival .  - an earthquake uncovers an 11-story tall gorilla in the himalayas .  a hunter , chosen because he just broke up with his girl and is at loose ends , gets sent to find the ape and finds a sort of female tarzan who controls the ape .  - evelyne kraft is the jungle girl in a leather bikini that she is pasted into so she always looks on the verge of bouncing out of .  - gorilla actor has no idea how gorillas move and suit is terrible .  nice miniature effects , however .  - has almost a music video inside it of jungle girl playing with animals like chi-chi the leopard .  - several places there is narrative that is nearly incoherent as if there are missing scenes and the viewer has to guess what happened in the interim .  - actual location shooting in mysore .  ape shown badly matted behind temple .  - combining of images usually pretty bad .  incompetent matching of film stocks .  - stock footage frequently used .  - gorilla brought to hong kong by greedy entrepreneur who really abuses the ape before it escapes and tears things up real good .  
0 there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling , hapless straight man from the hysterical " naked gun " films , crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he's committed himself to starring in since .  the wavering movie spoofs , however , are less forgivable .  to be fair , " wrongfully accused , " the send-up in question and nielsen's third parody since the last " gun , " isn't quite as excruciatingly humorless as his " dracula : dead and loving it " or " spy hard , " which is a mighty good thing .  nielsen is still in tip-top comedic form , able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns , but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them , and he needs one very soon .   " wrongfully accused " meshes together the premises of " the fugitive " and " patriot games , " casting its always game star as ryan harrison ( get it ? ) , a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married temptress ( kelly le brock ) .  she , however , sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband ( michael york ) - a crime actually committed by a one-armed , one-legged , one-eyed man ( aaron pearl ) .  harrison is arrested , found guilty and sentenced to death , but escapes from a prison bus , of course , and then is pursued by a determined u . s . marshal named fergus falls ( richard crenna , unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones' already smirky oscar-winning role ) .  there's also a mystery brunette ( melinda mcgraw ) and an assassination subplot involving the u . n . secretary general , but like any of it matters .   " wrongfully accused " gets off to an assured start , with an in-concert nielsen , touted " lord of the violin " by bare-chested posters , pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo-clad mosh in front of the stage .  nice touch .  most of the scenes that follow , however , never top the opener .   ( hysterical exceptions : the mentos and " baywatch " goofs . )  movie parodies are crammed in at an almost-subliminal rate , but most are empty .  when a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la " anaconda " or baseball players disappear into a " field of dreams " -esque cornfield , there's really nothing to laugh at .  other moments , like an interlude in a fishing shop , are so unfocused that you're not sure what you're supposed to be laughing at .  there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send-ups here , so it's possible that director/writer pat proft , by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two , guarantees something is sure to stick .  and what does stick sticks well , particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard-boiled dialogue , what those " naked gun " s ( which proft collaborated on ) did great ; these bits are so on-target that they allow you to remember " wrongfully accused " as an almost-halfway-there spoof instead of a lame-brained failure .  the movie might have been cursed to begin with , opening fast on the heels of " mafia ! " , from proft colleague jim abrahams , and " baseketball , " from proft colleague david zucker , but it's a strong possibility that nobody is going to be accusing " wrongfully accused " of being nielsen's funniest .  
1 the film " magnolia " can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests .  the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower .  they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart .  the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially .  from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain .  they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness .  whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one .   " magnolia " is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of " boogie nights " fame .  the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make " magnolia " memorable .  however , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing .  anderson's control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful .  he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of " magnolia's " scenes drag on too long .  any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending .  from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn't get boring .  it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot .  this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation .  every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees .  for example , cop john c . reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall's daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly .  the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer .  anderson's explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing .  the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously .  this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get .  the performances in " magnolia " are perfection .  this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting .  anderson allows many of hollywood's best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting .  all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film .  worth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance .  he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon's character as phillip baker hall's wife .  she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film .   " magnolia " uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters .  anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours .  to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity .  diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time .  i predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future .  
1 with many big-budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting .  the fifth element , the abyss , and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting , writing , or both .  at first glance , the matrix , larry & andy wachowski's sci-fi/kung-fu/shoot-em-up spectacular , looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high-concept bad movies , especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role .  but despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue , the matrix works .  it's an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout .  reeves plays neo , a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with " trinity " ( carrie-anne moss ) , a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks , a unseen , omniscient cult figure known as " morpheus " ( lawrence fishburne ) , and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell .  neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems .  moreover , he discovers that the grim , bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it .  neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah , with grave doubts that he is actually " the one " prophesized to come and save the world .  reluctant or not , what follows is a mix of hong kong-style slow-motion shootouts , surreal dream sequences , high speed chases , and comic book kung-fu fights .  the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality .  how exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind ?  and if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in , would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion ?  unfortunately , the matrix doesn't provide many answers to the questions it raises , but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions , shoot-outs , and flying roundhouse kicks .  perhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving , who plays agent smith , the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix .  weaving's stony appearance , deadpan voice , and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting , evil technological force that controls the matrix .  like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t-1000 terminator in terminator 2 : judgement day , weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because , despite his power and seeming invincibility , he looks ordinary , even scrawny .  weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence .  the film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography .  it seems to be deliberately kitchy , with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors .  in a few scenes , the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny .  just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring .  however , with the comic-book style and tone of the film , you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience .  the matrix isn't a classic .  its open-ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers .  it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions .  it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero - the kind of shmaltzy feel-good goo that most of the film avoids .  reportedly , the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel .  unfortunately , audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future .  the matrix is an fun , enjoyable diversion , like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival .  just don't be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry .  
0 joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory .  the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it .  it has a solid cast with tom hanks & meg ryan as the lead roles .  but you can never judge a movie by its cast . . .  if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano , it is that the plot is original .  unfortunately , it is also incredibly stupid .  the movie begins with joe ( tom hanks ) going to work .  this opening sequence is very boring and slow .  it shows joe walking to his office .  but on the way , he has to wait in a long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting .  a sequence like this should take 2 minutes .  here , it takes over 5 . . .  it is obvious that joe hates his job .  at his office , one of his co-workers is meg ryan .  oddly enough , she plays 3 different roles in this movie ! !  joe leaves to go to a doctor's appointment .  his doctor informs him that he has a " brain cloud . "  this means that in a few months , he will die .  so what does joe do ?  quit his job , of course ! !  when he arrives home , joe meets an old man named graynamore ( lloyd bridges ) .  graynamore tells joe that in order to get some important mineral for his company from an island , the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god .  by a startling coincidence , the boat trip to the island takes a few months .  by the time he reaches the island , he will almost be dead from the " brain cloud " anyway , so joe agrees .  graynamore gives joe a credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this " great adventure " .  joe goes on a date with meg ryan , his co-worker .  the day before the boat trip , joe meets one of graynamore's daughters .  she is also , surprise , meg ryan .  except she looks more hippyish .  they both have dinner and the next day , joe gets driven over to his boat .  the lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamore's daughters .  and , wonder of wonders , she is also played by meg ryan .  as they sail to the island , meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have a craving for orange soda .  after some stupid talking scenes , they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to .  and that the " brain cloud " thing was made up ! !  they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage .  joe goes fishing and catches a hammerhead shark .  this is a cheap gag that has been pulled off many times .  but , to top it off , the shark is obviously rubber and fake ! !  one night there is a storm .  a cheap-looking lightning bolt strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard .  fortunately , joe and meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage that joe brought to sail .  by pure luck , they get to the island .  since the natives like orange soda , they wear soda cans as attire ! !  stupid or what ?   ; ) before joe leaps in the volcano , he gets fed .  right before he jumps , meg ryan pleads him not to .  when joe decides to , she goes in with him because " she loves him " .  now this is where the movie should end .  but , unfortunately , the " cheesy ending " bug comes in .  the volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on joe's luggage .  they float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers .  i give this movie a .  see it only if you're a film buff that enjoys a bad movie every now and then or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan . . .  
0 nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air .  the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl .  the prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met .  if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should .  cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained .  and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough .  cage should have known what he was getting himself into .  he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production .  the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance .  in the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time .  that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness .  while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact .  audiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production .  in fact , the marketing people are counting on it .  no one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded .  director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) .  what he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense .  a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely .  if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up .  at a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool .  their tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) .  in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts .  it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance .  while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep .  his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies .  it doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over .  there's a word for people like you , nicolas .  that word is called recidivist . . . repeat  offender .  
0 plunkett & macleane is a period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions .  i have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking -- used properly it can save a movie ( see stigmata ) -- but it ruins this one , making a muddled , incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise .  there are certain genres that just don't go together .  the film opens with a sequence that i still don't understand .  it involves some sort of prison outbreak , a robbery , and a gem that keeps being eaten .  in any case , the caper ( whatever it may be ) brings together plunkett and macleane ( robert carlyle and johnny lee miller , respectively ) , two happy-go-lucky brits with no way to make a living .  they make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to america .  their first heist involves a young debutante named lady rebecca ( liv tyler ) ; a woman macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier .  his decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name " gentleman highwaymen . "  lady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord chief justice , a glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career .  he demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately , leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance ( ken stott ) who has a few more things on his mind than catching criminals .  meanwhile , macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett , who doesn't want his plans to be foiled by his partner's mindless romantic travails .  director jake scott , son of ridley scott ( alien , blade runner ) , has his father's knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill in actually moving the camera .  most of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid , jerky way that it's impossible to comprehend what's going on .  the camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity .  instead of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events scott uses attention-deficit-disorder edits .  he barely ever holds a shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems more like a couple frames between each cut .  the weird , almost defiant lack of dialogue ( there are no -- no -- conversations lasting over , say , 20 seconds ) undermines character definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters .  the love affair between macleane and rebecca is no different , emotionless and unrealistic .  when the script calls for macleane to decide between going to america and going to meet his lover , there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for him to abandon his goal ; he and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film .  plunkett and macleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over substance but since its style , quite frankly , blows , the film has no hope of succeeding on any level .  i wanted to appreciate this movie on the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace but i couldn't -- it was so kinetic it gave me a headache .  
0  " the 13th warrior " comes at the end of as summer where we've already experienced man eating sharks ( " deep blue sea " ) , man eating crocodiles ( " lake placid " ) and even a man hunting witch ( " the blair witch project " ) .  now , " the 13th warrior " presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears .  the story , if that's what you want to call it , follows ahmed ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) an arabian poet who falls in love with his king's wife and is banished from his home land .  he then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them .  eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men .  thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission , and as you guessed it , ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth .  he's not a warrior , and at first not well accepted by the vikings , but as the movie advances he'll have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield .  that's basically the entire plot .  there is also a romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and , one assumes , drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didn't just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story .  instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer .  the film is basically non- stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock .  the battle scenes , although well choreographed , are not involving and not the least bit exciting .  we don't get to know any of the characters and so we don't care who lives and who dies .  the film , which wants to be beowolf , comes across more as a failed action-adventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels .  it was directed by john mctiernan who's , " the thomas crown affair " is also playing in theaters currently .  and it's not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that , " the 13th warrior " was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences .  it belongs back on the shelf .  
1  " psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred " .  a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip-off .  but no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento's most consistently successful film .  what impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento's directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative .  screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions .  no question : argento has always been a better director than a writer .  fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called " suspiria de profundis " .  the film's storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches .  jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance .  arriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state .  what happens next - and i don't make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock's infamous shower scene in psycho .  it's quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento's own .  though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria's opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school .  we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well .  several more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn't want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film's climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that's most impressive .  the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about .  fortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film .  the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region .  and the soundtrack ?  it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else .  as it stands , the use of goblin's music in suspiria is outstanding .  apparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts .  a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer's overall experience .  even better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you'll get the added bonus of widescreen .  and the colours !  deep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast .  the cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb .  a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors .  these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento's more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked .  suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status .  the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that's always been one of argento's shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror .  
1 here's a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler's list is to jurassic park .  in 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler's list as the director's " penance " ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster ) .  now , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance .  once again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers .  now , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity .  that film is amistad .  although not as masterful as schindler's list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture .  thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact .  watching schindler's list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience .  spielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later .  aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since .  amistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent .  the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that's not a surprise .  however , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order .  several , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force .  on the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired .  one stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape .  led by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew .  adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey .  they are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut .  the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy .  the first men to come to the africans' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) .  they are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute .  aided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge .  but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin's cause .  current president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free .  at its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage .  cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to .  he is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up .  effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies .  they are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie's success .  to amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man's seemingly-strange " rituals " .  the larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity .  as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as " sub-human , " so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense .  the abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property .  in a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything .  amistad's presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history .  four claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them .  baldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque .  even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate .  aside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch .  matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his " pretty boy " image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case .  likewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than " abolitionists . "  nigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election .  finally , there's anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done .  hopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams .  his ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable .  one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler's list is this film's lack of a well-defined human villain .  schindler's list had ralph fiennes' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for .  there is no such figure in amistad .  the villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary .  it is to spielberg's credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist .  amistad's trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident .  an opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 , 1997 .  numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves .  it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg's rousing , substantive film leading the way , the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history .  
0 disney's " air bud " tells a boy-and-his-dog story with a twist -- the pooch is quite an accomplished basketball player .  granted , for a family comedy , it's not a very funny or successful idea to begin with , but it doesn't seem to matter -- " air bud " is surprisingly solemn .  save for occasional moments of forced slapstick , the movie wags its tale with a straight face -- not a very enjoyable approach .  if " air bud " had realized its own absurdity , then it possibly could have been better .  here , we're actually asked to cheer a moment when the dog marches out to save the big game , clad in two pairs of sneakers and even a jersey .  its number ?  k9 .  yeah , whatever .  the movie opens as golden retriever buddy ( as himself ) escapes from his current owner , abusive clown-for-hire norm snively ( michael jeter ) .  he ends up in fernwell , washington , where mopey new-kid-on-the-block josh ( kevin zegers ) is trying to cope with the move and the recent death of his father .  buddy , kevin .  kevin , buddy .  once the dog proves his on-court prowess , kevin's self-esteem rockets .  they both win places in the school's basketball team , with the animal as their mascot .  but before they can make it to the finals , snively surfaces to reclaim buddy .  everything plays out just as one would think : heavy on predictability , light on an actual story .  the movie follows a calculated chain of events -- kevin's gloom fades , snively gets his comeuppance and buddy contracts rabies and must be executed old yeller-style .  okay , that last one's a lie , but at least it would have been a quicker send-off than " air bud " 's courtroom climax -- no joke !  there's even a faux-cute musical montage where a reluctant buddy gets cleaned-up to " splish splash . "  paint cans are spilled and newspapers are buried , all in the name of formula .  the end credits note that " no special visual effects were used in the basketball sequences of this motion picture . "  that very well may be true , and although to see a dog sink shots is quite a sight , a movie cannot exist on feat alone .  but " air bud " doesn't seem to be interested in anything else .  a friend of mine insists he saw buddy a while back on a segment of david letterman's " stupid pet tricks . "  i can't think of a more appropriate connection -- this movie is a stupid pet trick .  
0 the formula is simple .  trap a varied group of people on an isolated location , then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one .  these have been the successful ingredients for many good films ( the thing , alien , aliens , and tremors to name a few ) .  so , why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad ?   ( see the relic for a particularly putrid example . )  perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient : effort and ideas .  deep rising meets these two requirements part way , but not enough to salvage the film .  treat williams is finnegan , the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services ( and their boat ) for any activity . . . no  questions asked .  this time , however , they may have gone too far .  their passengers , led by the ominous wes studi , are the type of multi-national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films .  and their cargo . . . let's  just say it has very high explosive potential .  what is the target of these thieves ?  why , the argonauticus , of course , a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage .  but something else is hunting the argonauticus . . . something  ancient and deadly .  by the time the thieves arrive , nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed .  and now the creature senses fresh meat !  so , you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew , joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald ) , and a thief with less lofty goals , trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep .  and the monster gets to pick them off one by one .  fortunately for the creature , this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer .  why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food .  if there's a more clarion call for unity , i don't know what it might be .  it's pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when .  there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end .  for the most part , the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience's impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first .   ( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou's life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad . )  treat williams is a passable hero , and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation .  but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy , very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way .  the biggest treat in the film , however , has to be pantucci , kevin j . o'connor's whining engine-boy , under finnegan's employ .  his constant quips may be a bit over-written , but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve-addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss , for that matter ) .  it's just a stock part ( the comic-relief character ) , but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable .  as far as the monster goes , although the cgi is done well , the creature has no logical consistency .  think back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters .  they all had a set of " rules " about what they could do , and how and why they would do it .  part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering , along with the heroes , just what those rules are .  the tentacle monster in deep rising doesn't have a set of rules . . .  or if it does , not a very good one .  it merely eats ( or drinks , as the case may be ) , and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so .  the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place .  it simply happens .  the action scenes are decent , but few are noteworthy .  the film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic .  deep rising's peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron's ( but can you really blame them ) .  unfortunately , deep rising's efforts are more on par with speed 2 .  on the plus side , however , the film's closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting ( but unlikely ) sequel .  perhaps you'd be better off waiting for that one .  
0 america loves convenience .  after all , we're the culture that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control .  yet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far .  ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill-poppin' , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve " demolition " williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home .  when she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed " the commander , " " the rookies , " and the guy with the cool accent discover the town's residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents' head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches .  filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences .  the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story .  ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie , ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next , stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose .  attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced .  most of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom , dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand of ice cube .  with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other , cube reminisces about his street life , comparing the zombie-stomping fun to " me and my brother when we was kids . "  apparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment .  but , even in the film's darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite .  yes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing beats a good stick of tnt .  and as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand .  characters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ?  as long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed .  eventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson .  what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns can't handle .  explosions are fun .  and even if the nukes don't get them , the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will .  in the end this film defines itself when our cop's tribunal pronounces , " is that all you have to tell us ? "  for , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say , and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story .  
0 i don't expect much from eddie murphy these days .  for the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another .  such films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures .  the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps .  the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places .  sherman has just invented a new " youth drink " that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time .  janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) .  with love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers .  with some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the " buddy love " link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker .  but one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . .  because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy .  then the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes .  and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ?  the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene .  pure and simple , the klumps is a failure .  its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes .  any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process .  it's more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash .  hey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes .  the characterization of sherman's family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema .  everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough .  the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts .  the father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings .  the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone .  the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood .  sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to .  but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy .  the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct .  and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn't act like this all the time .  the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic .  after a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story .  its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line .  even the best effects can't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days .  now that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make .  people will be lined up around the block for it .  the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 .  eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he'll play every character in the movie .  i just can't wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself .  
0 there have been bad films in recent years : 'mr .  magoo' was by far the worst ever made , the spectacularly bad 'blue in the face' , the horrible 'baby genuises' and now 'i woke up early the day i died' .  it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie .  the film's acting ( if that's what you want to call it ) is well mediocre to me .  loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit , boy was i wrong .  after escaping from a mental institution 'the thief' played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty .  he turns to burglary to survive , robs a loan back , kills the loan officer and runs with thousands .  a country-wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down .  he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later , comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere .  now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back , ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying .  a film which was based on a 'long-lost' script by ed wood , i have only one question : no dialogue , only music and movement where exactly is the point ?  the film moves along at a rather slow pace , but does have one advantage : the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some .  it opens with a fun , innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that .  some of the low points are when 'the thief' steals a woman's purse , and then she faints , sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom 'the thief' kills to the music of 'psycho' .  come on people get some new ideas already !  what's even worse is that the film has no plot at all .  well to a certain extent it does , but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we're bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen .  'i woke up early the day i died' is a perfectly bad film .  it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie .  even with the huge cast talent , the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours .  
0 making your first feature film ain't easy .  assemble a decent , if not , strong cast , as writer/director robert moresco has done with one eyed king , and you're already ahead of the game .  but rehash old plot lines , tired dialogue , and standard clich ? s , and a well-intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film .  how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse ?  the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another , but here we have it .  again .  five irish kids in nyc's hell's kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop .  with teary music .  and slow motion .  in the film's first scene .  the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults , unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen .  leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good-hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante .  i'd like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah , blah , blah , but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points .  he's concerned about buddy jason gedrick's heroin abuse .  he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin's character's sister .  he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic-looking counterfeit cash ever made ( a genuinely funny touch ) .  but none of this ever really amounts to anything .  it seems that moresco's greater concern is to provide that intangible " slice of life " , that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone's been trying to evoke since scorsese's early work .  so , we get the drunk guys , hugging and singing together at the local bar , to prove to us that they really love each other .   ( do people actually do this ! ? )  we get a lot of tough street talk -- usually mumbled for effect -- and a whole lot of the f-word , whether it sounds like it fits or not .  we also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose .  bruno kirby , chazz palminteri , you know , guys you've seen in movies just like this one before .  assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears , and baldwin's performance is adequate , but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it's almost funny .  moresco , a theater guy and sometimes tv writer ( including the series falcone ) , obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child , but the content is probably too personal .  as a result , the movie's style is heavy-handed , in need of a considerable amount of toning down .  nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids , moresco reminds us -- boy does he remind us .  with slow dissolves to the earlier scene , running in slow motion , complete with dialogue from the present , just in case we don't comprehend the link to the past .  moresco needs to either trust his audience's intelligence , or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it .  his next project should have a little more personal distance , and a lot more subtlety .  if he actually gets that chance .  reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage ( feature story coming soon ) .  
0 a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent , but one with no edge to it .  it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich ? s and stock characters of this genre .  though it's a well-written and well-acted fluff piece , it still does not have too much to say that is surprising .  it's made for the gentle art-house set , those who don't want something too disturbing to think about .  it's about a critically successful writer husband , alec ( pryce ) , who is so self-absorbed that he's threatened by his department store floor-walking model wife , kate ( bouquet ) , who wants to be a writer .  she meets his crass publisher , vanni corso ( walken ) , another self-absorbed man , and a predictable relationship occurs .  the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband's first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet .  she now wants her own identity and her independence .  the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff , and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie .  the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium , and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax .  it's set in london , and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper , vanni .  she later meets him as her hubby's new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality , and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel .  alec who is an obnoxious grouse , someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with , tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published--which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni .  the publisher is proud that he's a mamma's boy who never married and is a self-made man who has earned millions .  he has recently acquired a failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it , as he proudly tells kate : " if my father could sell pizzas in harlem , i could sell culture in europe . "  the only thing that couldn't be sold , is this stiff story and tired plot line .  the mystery to me , is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy .  she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon-to-become-beleaguered vanni .  when she writes a second novel , he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did .  it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one , as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper .  a business affair was loosely based on the real-life literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly , in their celebrated 1950s love triangle .  
1 the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of " leila , " a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features .  although unfamiliar with mehrjui's previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers .  set in modern-day iran , " leila " begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) .  as leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn't quite as sweet .  earlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child .  when all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn't care at all about having children .  nonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) .  bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with .  leila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn't give her full blessing .  there are no easy answers to be found within " leila , " a film that thoughtfully examines the central character's unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration .  almost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law's requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman .  maybe because " leila " is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence .  leila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances .  one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply .  it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible .  although seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another .  ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her .  these " small " moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman .  left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer .  refusing to stay over at her parent's house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below .  despite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him .  sure , the whole second marriage was his mother's idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn't he ?  in the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair .  unlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words .  every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else .  for all of its strong aspects , " leila " isn't a perfect film .  on a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed .  and concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before .  mehrjui's decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi .  despite these minor missteps , " leila " is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york's cinema village , and then on may 21 in la .  the thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila's self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return .  it's difficult to not consider how leila's culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through .  
1 with stars like sigourney weaver ( " alien " trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc . ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot .  sadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller .  helen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr . ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak .  incidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes .  a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco .  detective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first .  copycat " borrows " a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work .  but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also . . .  much of the time wasted could've been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama .  even so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments . . .  weaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona ) .  harry connick jr . , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter .  which comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please . . . ) .  copycat is a good thriller .  although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show , copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats , in anticipation of the killers next immediate move .  this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts .  nice movie to bring your girlfriend to . . . .  
1 the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy .  but after diasappointing films such as " godzilla " and " fear and loathing in las vegas " , it would be nice to see a really good film .  but i doubt you could have expected this .  the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen , and it deserves a spot on the " decade's best " list .  there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim , " yes , that's what makes this film great . "  the blend of peter weir's masterful ( and in many ways brilliant ) direction , peter biziou's stunning photography and jim carrey's performance is what makes this film work so fantastically .  there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show .  it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame , but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect .  carrey has made a very wise choice .  by playing mild-mannered truman burbank , he allows himself enough room to be comical , and therefore not alienating his true fans , while still showing a vulnerable and human side .  that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes .  truman burbank was born to an audience of millions .  he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show .  everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians , led by the show's director , christof ( played by ed harris ) .  everyone in truman's life is an actor or an extra .  they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe , people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in truman's life .  but he is the only person that is not aware of it .  the classification of the truman show may be tricky .  the audience reacted to many of truman's revelations with laughter .  i did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character .  the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes , because what was happening to him , indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong .  so is this going to end up labeled as a comedy ?  a drama ?  it really depends on the audience .  but to me , the truman show was a touching , sad tale about the extents to which a corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others .  but above all else , the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor , heart and scary realism .  oscar predictions in june are pointless , but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of 1997 , as originally planned , james cameron would be oscar-less .  
0 okay , okay .  maybe i wasn't in the mood to watch a mindless action movie ; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii , even while admitting that it wasn't as good as the others .  howewer , the latest segal picture didn't look that bad , and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them , i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash .  boy , was i wrong !  in the first half of the movie , we are already assaulted with segal's acting , ( he is not simply wooden ; he is like a wall ) , gratuitous violence , an incredible plot , sexist and even more gratuitous nudity , and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes .  by the end , it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers .  not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided , which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense .  of course , in movies like these , there must be a sidekick , and a love interest .  in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model ( in the movie ) , which only functions as a supposed comic relief ( by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines ) , and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie .  oh , of course , she appears naked from the waist up , and , of course , segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship ; they did not even seem to be interested in each other .  i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie .  often , the villain saves the movie ; unfortunately , the villains here are cartoonish , stupid and unfunny , unmenacing .  how many movies have psycho ex-special forces bad guys ?  too many .  i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie , including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death , the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him , the scene where we are shown the hero's superiors are stupid , the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand , etc . . .  simply said , this is movie-making by the numbers , boring , and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience .  my recommendation : if you go see it , bring a watch .  you'll be looking at it for most of the movie .  my .  rent die hard .  read a book .  stare at the sky .  do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid .  the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen ; once again , dragged in by my friends , which by the way , liked the movie halfheartedly .  they probably like wrestling too : - ) .  
0  " payback , " brian helgeland's inauspicious directing debut ( coincidentally , he previously penned the award-winning screenplay for 1997's " l . a . confidential " ) , is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea---a movie with non-stop violence , death , and villains---and runs with it , or should i say , barely manages to crawl away with it .  mel gibson , in yet another disappointing picture ( " conspiracy theory " and " lethal weapon 4 , " anyone ? ) , stars as the reprehensible villain/hero , porter , a man who becomes determined to get his 50% share of $140 , 000 , which he stole in a robbery , back when his partner-in-crime ( gregg henry ) and drug-addicted wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leave him for dead .  porter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay .  the tagline for " payback " is , " get ready to root for the bad guy , " and sure enough , this is true , as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way .  i wouldn't have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest , but it wasn't , and therefore , i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever .  no attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters , and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them .  just because the protagonist , a " bad guy , " is played by mel gibson doesn't mean i will " root for him , " and i didn't .  quite the contrary , every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up the dull proceedings ) .  since none of the respectable actors in " payback " actually have human beings to play , only one performance managed to stand out .  lucy alexis liu ( of t . v . 's " ally mcbeal " ) , who plays a spicy s&m dominatrix , brightens up every scene she is in , and has a definite flair for comedy , something i would have liked to have seen more of , since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat .  meanwhile , gibson , who is perfectly fine here , sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging .  unger , who made an impression in 1997's " the game , " is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback .  finally , kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax , and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb ( tellingly , he didn't appear in the original cut of the film , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later ) .  like most action movies , the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking .  in the course of the 102-minute running time of " payback , " porter is shot three times in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer .  and guess what ?  not only does he survive the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) ,  even though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag .   " payback " is not , in any way , an entertaining film , even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on , but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen .  perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours .  
0 i never understood what the clich ? " hell on earth " truly meant until very recently .  i've just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying , so horrible , so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as " hell on earth " .  after all , i've never been to war , i've never been the victim of any violent crime , i've never really been broken hearted , and i've never been audited ; so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was " hell on earth "  then i saw cruel intentions .  in a perfect world , i would be in charge of all the movie studios .  the very first thing i'd do in this perfect world , would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20-something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv , and throw them in jail .  but it wouldn't just be your average jail , not even a maximum security installation .  i'd have these producers ( and everyone else involved in the production of these films ) put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity .  now you're probably thinking to yourself : " is this really how bad cruel intentions is ? "  the answer is no .  it's actually much worse .  watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumble's awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound .  and then pouring acid on the salt .  i don't know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum ( tara reid ) whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet , but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom .  from that opening scene , where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz , to the conclusion which i don't remember because i had practically fallen asleep ; cruel intentions is truly " hell on earth , " right up there with war and tax audits .  
1 titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ?  as a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful .  if you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again .  the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers .  in either case , it is filmmaking at its best .  when we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long .  he said no but that the time would go by so fast she'd never notice the length .  amazingly , he was right .  titanic is one of the few long films that doesn't suffer because of it .  the lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean .  fortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world's most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as " the ship of dreams . "  the necklace's hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story .  although almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk .  using a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing .  after twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage .  in a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast .  the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing .  entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane .  and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class .  even with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes .  in contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board .  after jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair .  never tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story .  leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma .  in so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part .  when he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal's supercilious put-downs .  kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose .  the chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what's eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing .  from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship's bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances .  if the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year .  peter lamont's sets are more than authentic .  one scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck .  it then shifts to the ship's massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals .  the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner .  easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest .  at first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else .  what a lark .  we've struck an iceberg .  now let's get back to our brandy and cigars .  the ship's musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in .  after all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers .  when the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it .  their civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless .  the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface .  there are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on .  special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable .  in titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs .  the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water .  people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately .  besides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor .  from the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears .   " it's good-bye for a little while , " a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first .   " this boat's for mommies and children .  there'll be a boat in a little while for daddies . "  basically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats -- it made the decks look too crowded otherwise .  perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim's on-board the ship .  in the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink , he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew .   " no thanks , " the elegantly attired guggenheim replies .   " we're dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen .  but we would like a brandy . "  titanic runs 3 : 14 .  it is rated pg-13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up .  
1 in , " the muse " albert brooks plays steven phillips , a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio .  they claim that he's lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them .  he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over .  so he turns to his " best " friend , jack ( jeff bridges ) another screenwriter who's enjoyed success after success .  on the way over to jack's house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman ( sharon stone ) into a cab and begins to think : is he having an affair ?  when confronted , jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is , in fact , a muse , a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity , and has helped him garner his success .   " she doesn't do any actual writing , " he is told , " but inspires you . "  steven is excited by what he's hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if she'll take steven on as a new client .  jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present , preferably something from tiffany's .  after the meeting the muse , sarah decides to take on steven , but at a price : she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her ( like bringing her salads in the middle of the night . )  steven's wife ( andy macdowell ) sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon .  steven confesses everything and , although at first suspicious , she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life .  the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he's going through for her .  and that's a question only time will tell .   " the muse " is albert brooks' sixth film as writer/director/actor ( he co-wrote with monica johnson ) and although it's a good movie it's not up to the level of his best works ( " defending your life " and " mother " ) .  the problem lies in the script , and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor , there aren't nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good one-liners .  it has a great premise but doesn't deliver up to it's full potential .  but , i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit .  he may whine and complain , but he just wants to support his family and be happy .  and i like sharon stone in this movie too ; it's a nice change of pace for her .  and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner , james cameron and martin scorsese .  and although " the muse " doesn't have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman's " the player " i still left the theater feeling good .  and that's something i wish i got out of more movies .  
0 best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on .  usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do .  if you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda .  cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge .  big john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad .  what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light .  he's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . )  he'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world .  l . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia .  filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) .  in his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e .  highway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 .  he's both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do .  this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it . )  l . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven .  there is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger .  rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length .  concurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted .  cox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster .  dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent .  we're so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene .  the restraint is admirable .  but l . i . e . 's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material .  when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious .  director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach's goldberg variations .  it's too much .  there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john's other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie .  this plot thread predictably leads to violence .  not content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff's superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note .  it's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note .  in this regard , l . i . e .   ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed .  how often does real life work this way ?  to extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ?  
0 the " fab 4 " of ronald reagan high are four stuck-up girls , played by rose mcgowan , rebecca gayheart , julie benz and charlotte roldan , who overdress like 4 posh spice wannabes .  their daily ritual is to parade up and down the school halls like royalty , and their constant reflex action is to grab their compacts so they can check their make-up and powder their cheeks .  under no circumstances will they ever let themselves be seen eating in public .  in writer and director darren stein's jawbreaker , it isn't as funny as it sounds .  in fact , it isn't funny at all .  stein has taken the black comedy of a teen movie like heathers and stripped it of any intelligence , wit or charm .  his actresses toss off their lines so fast that they don't have time to add any emotion .  and all of his female characters have considerably more lipstick than brains .  the setup for the movie has one of the fab 4 , liz , who is referred to as " the princess di of reagan high , " be killed when a prank by the other 3 goes wrong .  the princess di reference is in bad taste , as is much of the movie .  granted , bad taste can sometimes be funny , but the mere presence of bad taste doesn't guarantee it .  liz's girlfriends stick a jawbreaker that is literally larger than a golf ball in her mouth , tape her mouth shut , and stick her bound body in the trunk of a car .  when they open the trunk later , liz is dead .  they eventually put her blue and bruised body into a sexual position and make it look like liz was the victim of a brutal rape .  these realistic and disgusting scenes of a dead , seminude teen have a pornographic feeling that is hard to forget and will likely turn the stomach of many a viewer .  the film's dialog not only isn't funny , it's trite .  one nerdy young girl introduces herself with " my name is fern mayo , as in hold the mayo . "  when fern discovers what has happened , the fab 3 make her an offer she can't refuse -- make-up !  they cake it on her and welcome her to the clan .  the parents in the movie brag about learning parenting skills from watching oprah .  the teachers fare no better , especially in the ridiculous lines they are given .   " miss shayne , please cover your bosom , " one young teacher , who has been made up to look old and ugly , says without any conviction .   " this is a learning institution , not a brothel . "  besides the obvious question of why this movie was ever made , there is one other question that i'd like to ask the director .  why do you have a phone number start with 555 if you going to cover the rest of the number anyway ?  in a cameo , pam grier plays detective vera cruz , who investigates liz's murder .  as she interrogates the other people , she stares at them like they are all idiots , proving that she is the only one that gets it .  i am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movie , she'd walk out after about 5 minutes , and you'd be well advised to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in a theater showing it .  jawbreaker runs 1 : 27 .  it is rated r for violence , gore , profanity and sex .  i would advise everyone to avoid it , but if teenagers go they should be older and mature .  
0 'bicentennial man' is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment .  chris columbus , the director who gave you " mrs . doubtfire " , plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point .  based on the short story by isaac asimov , it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human , which as you can imagine is very difficult .  starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children .  soon this robot , called andrew ( robin williams ) shows abilities that makes his owner mr . martin ( sam neill ) very curious .  andrew is interested in art and music , he " enjoys " making clocks , which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions .  it shows out that because of a small failure in the " electrical circuits " and " positronic brain " andrew has accidentally gained a soul .  this makes him unique and his evil creators worried .  then mr . martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn't programmed to do .  soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom , destiny and love .  this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner , a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction .  ever since that film , the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy .  what makes us human ?  the thoughts ?  the emotions ?  is it possible to become human ?  at what point can we say to a robot " now you are one of us " ?  these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach .  it is obvious that columbus didn't take them very seriously .  when you think about it , this film is not really meditating on the question " when is a robot no longer a machine , but a human being ? " , but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding .  andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being , and only the society has troubles with it .  in other words , it is as far from reality as from the academy awards .  further more , there are other annoying problems .  to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now .  this has not been done for obvious reasons , because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task .  columbus is the first to have crossed that line .  the result is , as you might imagine , primitive , unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort .  the world is simply frozen in time .  neither the society , fashion , culture or values have changed over 200 years .  mom is still working at the kitchen , doing the dishes .  when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today , you'll see a slightly bigger difference .  i am not saying that everything should change .  it is unlikely that the human rights will change , but it's even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science , technology and fashion .  i suppose it's possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale , but it's really hard .  robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way .  as always he does a decent job , as does sam neill .  but it doesn't really matter .  it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience .  pretty much like last year's " meet joe black " , this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesn't deserve .  great actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten .  when isaac asimov wrote this story , the future seemed far away and magical .  everything seemed possible .  now is the future of asimov's time , and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago .  for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne's " 20 000 leagues under the sea " , so can't we accept this story as a potential reality .  let us hope that next year's " a . i . "  will be more rewarding .  
1  " the celebration " is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant .  you know , where you sit down to watch it , and no matter what you've heard about it before , you just can't help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs .  i prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like .  i don't really feel there are to be any real " rules " for cinema ; a film can do anything , as long as it makes it work .  but i do ask that all films have one thing in common : they create experiences .  when i watch a film , no matter what kind of film it is , i want to be able to take certain memories along with me .   " the celebration " is great because it's chock full of those .  it creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life .  and then it makes things just a tad bit farscial , just to make sure you're paying attention , which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored , then you're of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up .  the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him .  all his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) .  the eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father's home .  his brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable .  we then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she's going to .  once they're all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film's punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age .  but since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it's all terribly interesting to watch .  twists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends .  the most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion .  as a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose " the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability " so that they may " purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot . "  i have not seen " breaking the waves , " the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but " the celebration " works exquisitely in this department .  it feels like reality , like you're actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video .  as a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to .  we see key moments in people's lives that they wouldn't dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film .  the key , though , to this film , and the reason it's not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth .  throughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water .  of course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn't have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them .  and yes , it's thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier .  but then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he's done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface .  the final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex .  everyone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them .  the actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest : there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays , exactly like life .  as such , " the celebration " may be the one truly bizarro film of the year : a work of art so eerily close to reality that it's utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating .  
0 i had an epiphany today .  it occurred to me while i was watching " house on haunted hill . "  it is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it's advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ?  chances are , there * is * truth in advertising .  too bad i didn't trust my own instincts when something-or-the-other possessed me to see this movie .  i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of " sleepy hollow . "  that and " dogma " started too late in the afternoon for my schedule .  an hour of " angel " or " buffy " is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face .  i wish i'd seen it when it was halloween .  at least i would have been forgiving .  hey , tis the season .  the movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn't going anywhere .  now i truly appreciate films like " scream , " " halloween , " or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic .  that's what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know .  there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with .  sure , utterly unpredictable is good , too , but that's different from utterly nonsensical .  hohh ( house on haunted hill ) , on the other hand .   .   .  well let's just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh-so-cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago .  riiiiight .  y'know , that just sends chills down my spine .  yeah .  just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil .  ooooooo .  hint : blood and guts only work a few times .  sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it's just ketchup and props and you've got to come up with something better than that .  there were just too many things in this movie that we've all seen before ; from the inevitable " plot developments " of strangers unwittingly trapped together ; strangers turning against each other ; the evil manifesting itself ; the dead coming back for a last scare .  each was more predictable than the last .  why didn't these fools just stay together in one place anyways ?  sheesh .  was i grossed out ?  yes .  did i get spooked a few times ?  yes .  but why ?  i get really disturbed when there is no why .  when there weren't random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect ( which wasn't that good either , trust me ) and the scare , the film was filled with drab , laughable dialogue .  the characters were incredibly flat and cliched .  not to mention downright annoying .  you've got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives ; of course they're dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night .  jeez , i thought no one fell for those " you may already be a winner " things anymore .  and of course , all three gals are babes .  i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of " shine " ended up in this movie .  keep that up , geoff , and you'll qualify for the next batman venture .  the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because , well , he just cracks me up .  and famke jansen ( sp ? )  because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan .  pierce brosnan ( hey , i willingly endured " dante's peak " three times for him : ) .  all right , i concede .  there were a couple of things i enjoyed .  that perverted little amusement park at the beginning .  i probably won't ride a rollercoaster for a while .  and the machine they used to drive geoffrey's character mad ( see , i don't even remember their names ) .  the machine , not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it .  i kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie .  it wouldn't have redeemed the film , but at least it would have made me feel better .  but no , they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending .  thank god they didn't add a kiss at the end or i would have puked .  god , there is no hope .  
1 plot : a dude and his brother are driving cross-country and decide to fool around with a trucker on their cb radio .  it isn't long before their little prank gets someone put into a coma ( long story ) and the next thing you know , the trucker is following them too .  lotsa nuttiness ensues and then , they pick up their other friend , venna , a girl who the dude has a crush on .  but what's this . . . ?  the trucker is still on their tail and is now harassing all three of the young whippersnappers . . . ?  you bet !  buckle up , dorothy . . . this is gonna be one bumpy ride !  critique : a good ol' time at the movies !  here's a film that actually gives away most of its plotline in its trailer and doesn't really bring anything " new " to the forefront ( if you've seen flicks like duel and breakdown , you've crossed this path before ) , but still manages to entertain you gangbusters , with realistic situations , believable characters , funny moments , thrills , chills , the whole shebang .  let's give it up for director john dahl , who continues to put out solid films every other year ( if you haven't seen red rock west , do yourself a favor right now , and jot it down on a piece of paper and rent it at your earliest convenience ) .  and much like that film , this one has an excellent premise and sets everything up at an even pace .  it gives you a little bit of background on each of the main three characters , and then shows you how one small prank , can lead to a whole lotta trouble for everyone !  paul walker really surprised me in this movie , since i've never much thought of him as anything more than a pretty face ( and damn , is it ever pretty or what ? ! )  but here , he actually manages to put some depth behind the looks and that's always appreciated in films in which you are so closely tied to the main characters .  sobieski is also good , but she isn't in the movie for as long as you'd think , but the man who really takes this film to another level , is steve zahn .  if you've loved this guy as the " goofball " in most of his previous roles , you'll appreciate him even more here , as the dude who starts off as one of the most manic and excited human beings i've seen in quite some time ( " this is so awesome ! ! " ) ,  only to turn into a man scared out of his wits by the end of the flick .  and speaking of the ending , boy , does this movie deliver some chilling moments during its final 15 clicks or what ? ! ?  the arrow and i were practically in each others arms ( well , maybe i'm exaggerating , but you catch my drift ) as each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn , took it all to an even higher level .  once again , kudos to director dahl for being able to generate that type of intensity , suspense and tension , with a great score , editing , style and camerawork .  plot-wise , i too did wonder how the " bad guy " was able to track them so well , but it didn't really bother me all that much ( you can assume that he had bugged their car ? ) .  but pretty much everything else in the story stuck like glue and i couldn't help but put myself in their shoes and appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance .  a great movie with an even cooler ending , this film will likely be remembered as one of the better thrillers of the year .

0 in 1970s , many european intellectuals , especially those on the left political hemisphere , became obsessed with the rise of fascism .  which wasn't so hard to expect , because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies .  in such times , when political involvement could be associated with noble passion , many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre-war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany .  of course , there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other , less noble reasons .  for them , moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era .  which , naturally , made some of those films very popular among teen audience .  one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass , who later made career shooting expensive , stylish soft porn .  salon kitty , his 1976 film , is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern , book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2 .  in 1939 , walter schellenberg , one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite , exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats .  none of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents , and that all the rooms happened to be bugged .  the most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty , nominal madame of the brothel , didn't know the real purpose of that enterprise .  screenplay by tinto brass , of course , simplifies the story and changes few names .  schellenberg is now wallenberg ( helmut berger ) , ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top .  kitty kellerman ( ingrid thulin ) , apart from being madam , has a second job as a cabaret singer .  caught in the net of depravity is sweet , innocent girl margerithe ( theresa ann savoy ) thrown into brothel .  there she falls in love with customer hans reiter ( bekim fehmiu ) , disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe .  when margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel , she finds out that the place is bugged .  she informs the madam of the real situation , and both women decide to confront wallenberg .  those who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film , that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation .  but , although salon kitty doesn't happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn ( although not very successful ; some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing ) , it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict - this time between power-hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty .  unfortunately , brass seems to overuse other cinematical references , probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino visconti's the damned , but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulin's unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minelli's musical numbers from cabaret .  all in all , salon kitty is failure , although with some very interesting moments .  
1 if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child , would you do it ?   " gattaca " is a film which presents a future where society has answered " yes " to this question , but then ponders if this was actually the right decision .   " gattaca " came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature , the lovable dolly the sheep , and with this in mind , the film only becomes more frightening .  the way the realm of genetics is heading , it may only take a couple decades until the future " gattaca " presents becomes true .  contrary to the misleading trailers , " gattaca " is not a sci-fi thriller , in the way that there's lots of murder , hitchcockian suspense , and chase scenes .  this is a quiet , sad film about intelligent theories .  in fact , the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who's novel " brave new world " featured genetically engineered children ) .  it's a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia , which is exactly what " gattaca " presents . . . and the main reason i dug it so much .  the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) , a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems , and a prospected life span of around 30 years .  as a child , he was put down because of the threats of genetics , while his younger genetically perfect brother , anton ( loren dean ) , was promised whatever his heart desired .  vincent yearns to be an astronaut , but when he gets a job at a giant space company , it's as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss ! ) .  but one day , he finds out that it's probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist ( or something ) , german ( " wings " ' tony shalhoub , who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in '97 : " men in black , " " a life less ordinary " . . . ) , who's client is a genetically perfect man , jerome morrow ( jude law ) , who has unfortunately been crippled .  fortunately , though , there's no record of the accident , and he's willing to give someone else his life .  since vincent looks a bit like him . . .  after a couple alterations ( some minor , some really major ) , he has donned the life of jerome , and is doing his job .  there , he meets a genetically imperfect woman , irene ( uma thurman , who's genetically perfect in real life anyway , hee hee ) , and the two begin a kind of relationship , albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man's stats are .  however , a murder of a high-level worker at his office is killed , and one of vincent/jerome's eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi-wily inspector , hugo , ( alan arkin ) , and none other than vincent's long lost brother , anton , who hasn't seen him since they were teenagers .  we know vincent/jerome didn't do it , but with his older picture being posted everywhere , not only vincent/jerome's in trouble , but also the real jerome , who's as much in it as he is .  however , there isn't many big suspense set pieces , which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in , the film would lose it's message and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la william gibson .  the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin .  while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening , there are no big distractions from the point of the film , much to the dismay of commercial audiences .  what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created .  irene has no real spunk in her life , and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people .  and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man , claiming that his accident was really no accident .  what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that , and the ending is shocking as it's a definite work of dystopian propaganda , but doesn't have the down ending of other works of this kind .  the production design of this film is probably the best i've seen this year : it's stunning , very pleasing to the eye , but still very cold .  since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement , the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity , and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery .  and the sequence of all the high-level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam-esque feel to it , showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie-like life .  the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy .  the acting from everyone is great , with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance , and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway ( interesting pointless fact : uma and ethan started dating after this film , and currently she is pregnant with his child ) .  but the best performance belongs to jude law , who steals every scene he's in , and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden .  i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child , but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i'm not sure of .   " gattaca " warns us not to go any farther , chiefly because we'll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy , and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are .  and when i see a possible future featuring a 12-fingered piano player , well folks , that just creeps me out .  
0 if you're debating whether or not to see _breakfast_of_champions_ , ask yourself one simple question : do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie ?  the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph's chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross-section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight .  everyone else--and i'm hoping that's most people--would be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess .  actually , though , the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle , which focuses dwayne hoover ( bruce willis ) , the owner of dwayne hoover's exit 11 motor village in midland city .  not only is he a huge success as a businessman , he's also something of a celebrity , his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials .  with a nice home and family to boot , dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy--yet he's not .  his wife celia ( barbara hershey ) is perpetually in a pill-induced haze ; his son george ( lukas haas ) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name " bunny . "  not only that , the environmental protection agency is on dwayne's ass over a building development project .  it's enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown--that is , if he doesn't succeed in blowing his brains out first .  meanwhile , midland city is about to host a fine arts festival , and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout ( albert finney ) , a writer who is far from the renowned author the festival's organizer ( buck henry ) was led to believe--in fact , he's a penniless hack who writes second-rate sci-fi that appears in porn magazines .  his trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey , one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne , who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of life's answers .  the above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews , but , ironically , i have barely scratched the surface .  i haven't yet mentioned wayne hoobler ( omar epps ) , an ex-con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly-named dwayne .  then there's the matter of francine ( glenne headly ) , dwayne's devoted secretary .  not to mention dwayne's employee and old friend harry lesabre ( nolte ) , the one with the secret penchant for cross-dressing .  and so on .  the film is essentially dwayne's story , but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is .  rudolph does arrive at a point ( more on that later ) , but it's blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material .  the surreal visual style , complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwayne's ears , is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness , but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad .  the actors are called on to act accordingly , resulting in some of the worst , most overdone work all of them have ever turned in .  willis fares best of all--but that's because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience .  with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time , it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious , and rudolph tries to make a statement .  unlike _american_beauty_ ( a film that _breakfast_ resembles in more than a few ways , to its great detriment ) , there isn't any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift .  as such , the cartoony characters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned ; and the film attempts , to no avail , to reach a profundity that it doesn't deserve .  vonnegut's original novel is considered a classic , but it had been called unfilmable--the same that was said of hunter s . thompson's _fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas_ , which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam .  with the similar failure of _breakfast_of_champions_ , will hollywood ever learn that books labeled " unfilmable " inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable ?  likely not .  
1 steven spielberg's second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film .  spielberg , ever the student on film , has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest , and most powerful entries .  he also managed to cast this era's greatest answer to jimmy stewart , tom hanks , who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle .  for about 160 out of its 170 minutes , " saving private ryan " is flawless .  literally .  the plot is simple enough .  after the epic d-day invasion ( whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular ) , capt . john miller ( hanks ) and his team are forced to search for a pvt .  james ryan ( damon ) , whose brothers have all died in battle .  once they find him , they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home .  accompanying miller are his crew , played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational .  barry pepper , adam goldberg , vin diesel , giovanni ribisi , davies , and burns are the team sent to find one man , and bring him home .  the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary .  literally .  there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film's first 20 minutes .  spielberg films almost the entire movie without music , leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion , and they do to perfection .  the sequences in france , all of them , beginning with the battle and ending with the battle , are fabulous , especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides , trying to save private ryan .  there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences .  this is what coppola was looking for in " apocalypse now " , but couldn't create .  the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war .  the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary .  he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world , with his comic timing , dramatic flair , his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears .  hanks is this country's finest actor , and he proves it here .  however , spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece .  with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time , spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film .  the sequence involving army chief-of-stafff george marshall and mrs . ryan is decent , but doesn't hold up to the rest of the film , relying on wartime cliches to power it .  but that is forgivable .  what isn't is the bookends of the film , the cemetary sequences .  the first one is quite good , a decent introduction into the lives of these men .  the last sequence is atrocious .  the forced emotion , accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music , is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film .  these flaws are what downgrade " ryan " from the greatest film of our era , to the greatest war film of our era .  spielberg should have trusted his own material , and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie , to end his masterpiece right there .  the use of the flag , though patriotic , is in contrast to the movie's theme .  the power of the bulk of the film , however , is astonishing .  spielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art , that persists even after first viewing of the film , is extraordinary .  this is the film of the year .  
0 take a look at the following equation . . . .  a christmas carol+ghostbusters=scrooged  yes , scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment , comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether .  scrooged is alternatively sick , gross , funny , and then sickly soppy .  bill murray plays frank cross , a t . v executive with a horrible personality .  he's evil to secretary , actors , crew , everyone , except the t . v's station's boss , of course ( played by the late robert mitchum ) however , he is then visited by a very dead exec , who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts , past , present and future ( who is called the ghost of yet to come , for some reason ) sure enough , they arrive , show cross how much of a s . o . b he is , and he changes his way .  however , throughout this simple plot , we've got to suffer outlandish special effects , poor comedy , and an very , very mean performance from bill murray .  frank cross isn't 'funny' mean , he's just mean .  he also isn't very good at emotional scenes , and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film , with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is , and how he has changed .  however , the supporting cast are ok , with good performances from mitchum , allen ( who plays his girlfriend ) and john glover ( who plays cross's 'partner' ) the ghost of christmas past isn't that bad either .  sadly , though , the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of 'home alone' style violence from the ghost of christmas present , played by carol kane .  whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny , should be fired straight away .  and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait ( the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3 , if i remeber correctly . . . . )  who , thankfully , dosen't say much .  the script is horrendous .  michael o'donaghue churns out terrible , bad taste jokes ( which i guess is the whole point really ) then changes direction completely to emotional scenes .  and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes , which are awful .  the special effects look nice , but do nothing for the film .  there's some impressive make up effects also .  the music is also good , which is scored by danny elfman .  but great effects and make up don't make a great film .  scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience , seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway , and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech .  why didn't cross just look out his exec window , and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him ?  overall , then , you'd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided ( perhaps a plague )  
1 you've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi , but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over `keeping the faith' .  it's a fluffy comedy , thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer , regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head-on .  as youngsters , brian finn , jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio .  while their friendship progressed , anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support , so neither would feel excluded .  but tragedy soon struck , as anna was forced to move away .  now adults , brian ( edward norton ) and jacob ( ben stiller ) hold similar but contrastive jobs .  the likable and kind-hearted father brian is a catholic priest , while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi .  on the basketball court , they refer to themselves as `the god squad' .  in the relationship field , brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy , but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory .  everything changes when anna ( jenna elfman ) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums .  now a workaholic , she devotes endless hours per week to her business , but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob - both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again .  with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail , there's bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters .  predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult , but `keeping the faith' is open , entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b .  edward norton has emerged as one of the finest , most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller `primal fear' .  after shockingly bitter roles in `american history x' and , most recently , david fincher's vicious `fight club' , a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice .  not in the least .  norton slips into the director's chair for the first time with `keeping the faith' , and here his incisive , resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg .  weighing every aspect , it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut .  in addition , norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian , generating a thoroughly likable screen presence .  stiller ( the zipper guy from `there's something about mary' ) is firm and funny , boasting a fully-ripened comic maturity .  elfman's perky repetition can grow tiresome ( such is occasionally the case on tv's `dharma and greg' ) , but she seems perfectly rambunctious here .  the remaining cast members offer fine support , from anne bancroft as jacob's animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice .  `keeping the faith' is the perfect date flick . . .  though perfection is not a word to associate with the film in general .  there is turbulence during the process of lift-off , as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead .  once the film does settle in , it is often funny and always cheerful .  stiller , norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities .  we enjoy their interaction , understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true .  this is excluding the ending , which is acceptable and all , but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements .  nonetheless , a narrowly mishandled finale certainly won't wipe the smile off your face , nor anyone else's in the audience .  `keeping the faith' is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy , although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion .  aww , what the hell .  the quality is not quite heaven-sent , but this little charmer could revive our `faith' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre .  
1 >from the man who presented us with henry : the portrait of a serial killer ( 6 . 5/10 )  comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida's south coast .  plot : guidance counselor ( dillon ) is accused of raping one of his students .  she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida .  the counselor is brought to court on the charges , as another white trash girl ( campbell ) , also joins the rape finger-pointing club .  as the story unfolds , we find that many things aren't exactly as they seem ( that's as much as i could say without ruining anything ) .  critique : good little flick that slows down at certain points , and runs a tad long , but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout .  mind you , i could see many people not liking it because it takes " one too many " twists and turns , but hey , i happen to like that kind of thing .  and besides , the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability ( or scathingly close to ) , and even " explained " many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film ( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits . . . it  really does clear up some stuff ! ! ) .  other than that , the acting was good , with campbell transforming her " good girl stereotypical " role into a pot-smoking , goth-looking white trash chick out for a good time .  denise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywood's jelly-donut pinup girl of the moment , and proves that all breast implants needn't lead to lawsuits .  bacon is solid , and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! ) .  sprinkle the story with a bunch o' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters , bacon showing the world the size of his ding-dong ( do we really need to see this ? ? ) , a couple of lesbian kissing scenes , and a menage-a-trois , and you've got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre .  on the down side , the soundtrack was not as prominent ( or slick ) as i thought it would be , and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible . . . . ooooh ,  i almost forgot bill murray's exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court .  murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex , greed and mystery .  little known facts : neve campbell specified a non-nudity clause in her contract ( she's also born in guelph , ontario . . . go  hoser ! )  director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together , as it was gratuitous .  kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother , called the bacon brothers , is married to actress kyra sedgwick , and has a game based on him called " six degrees of kevin bacon " .  
0  " love to kill " starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes .  at the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who's an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman .  danza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his .  everything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs .  much confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza's begin to emerge , all after one thing or another .  sound confusing ?  it is .  i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity .  in some respects , it works .  but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess .  characters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen .  the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman's sister .  but so little time is devoted to this part of the story , we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , we don't really care what happens to them .  well , i didn't , at least .  one thing i will give the movie is that it's a complete departure for tony danza .  here's a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , who's ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing .  here , he plays a man who's just looking out for himself , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin , so be it .  i was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona .  michael madsen is also good as an associate of danza's who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him .  like i said , it's not exactly a linear storyline .   " love to kill " should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre , but it's just too bad that the story doesn't really add up to much .  the stars deserved better , and so did the audience .  
1 as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet .  i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online .  and i wonder : is that so bad ?  well , the commercial part is .  as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i'll be okay .  to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act .  they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious .  tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ?  meg ryan , america's high school sweetheart , can act .  she's had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don't , get the movie-- fantastic ) .  but , i like her best when she's , well , perky .  she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime .  some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don't really know .  all i know is that i just like them both .  they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist , and i'm not going to even try .  they're just really , really cute , sweet , and charming .  hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle .  here , the setup is a little different .  kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children's bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her .  she is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) .  she is also having an affair , of sorts .  you see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 .  they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is .  ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) .  fox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children's bookseller named " shop around the corner " , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly .  every morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight " to the death ! ! " .  it's a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have .  it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no " let's have sex tonight " mantra , if you'll excuse my bluntness .  this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love .  hmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan " hook up " , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness .  you know it's going to happen , the question is now ?  thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids .  it's all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good .  hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is .  he is , i believe , america's greatest actor .  does he show it here ?  nah .  but he's still tom hanks , and she's still meg ryan .  which is what this movie boils down to .  it's pure confection .  all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it's all really sweet .  there are some immense flaws , like pacing .  the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it's slow .  once hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow .  i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour .  the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated .  e-mail ?  when my kids are my age , i don't know what we'll be using .  but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history .  they just work together , and it's nice to see .  it gives you , well , a smile .  the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake .  i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was .  i've always believed that movies are very powerful , very powerful indeed .  you see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate .  movies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i'd rather not think about that .  i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night .  and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had .  hanks was the driving force behind one of the year's best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world .  he's also half of the glue behind the year's best example of pure entertainment .  tom hanks and meg ryan are magical , as is this movie .  it's a sweet , lovely affair with a technology twist .  it may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face .  
1 almost a full decade before steven spielberg's saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both " anti war " and " pro-soldier " , john irvin's hamburger hill proved it could .  lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone's platoon , this excellent film was dismissed as " too militaristic " .  it's hard to understand exactly why---unless irvin , in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable ( and often naive ) reasons " chose to show up " for the vietnam debacle , ---has refused to present us with the stone killer , drug-stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what " the polack , the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn " became to wwii movies .  hamburger hill , based on a true story , is not an easy film to watch .  there is a scene that will have graying anti-war activists squirming in their seats , or moved to genuine tears .  and the climactic final assault on the " hill " in question is visually confusing .  gristly realities are presented in brief flashes , as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered .  and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee , veteran and " newbie " , black soldier and white , become almost indistinguishable from each other , as they do in the chaos of actual combat .  the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b . vance as doc--in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as " seaman jones " in mctiernan's red october .  if you've seen private ryan , you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill--if only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielberg's vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach .  
0 louie is a trumpeter swan with no voice .  in order to woo his lady love serina , louie makes friends with a young boy , sammy , who persuades teacher mrs . hammerbottom ( carol burnett ) to allow louie to attend class .  louie learns to read and write and returns to his flock , but is laughed at once again when no other swans can understand his message of love for serina .  to make matters worse , louie's father feels he's lost his honor because of the trumpet he stole for his son in this animated version of e . b .  white's " trumpet of the swan . "  as jane austen and henry james have become popular sources for adult filmmakers over the past decade or so , e . b .  white is being returned to for children's films .  the animated " charlotte's web " has become a minor classic since its release in 1973 and 1999 brought us a live action version of " stuart little . "   " trumpet of the swan , " directed by richard rich ( 1999's animated " the king and i , " the " swan princess " series ) , is unlikely to be remembered along with those two .   " trumpet of the swan " is receiving a regional theatrical release , but is sure to quickly appear on home video .  boston is one of the targetted cities because our hero louie becomes famous playing his trumpet in beantown .  he encounters a gypsy-like con man in the public gardens who pitches louie and his trumpet as an added attraction to boston's swan boats .  louie stays at the ritz carlton before giving a concert at the hatch shell along the banks of the charles river .  at this point , louie's earned enough money so that dad can pay for the trumpet and become musically capable enough to win over serina's father .   " trumpet of the swan " features flat background art , some poor sound syncing and insipid , sugary songs .  this effort would be better suited to saturday morning television than the big screen , but may be ok for the real small set .  
0 some movies i should just skip .  my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program .  true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it's a cartoon .  but it's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen .  but my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ?  turns out i was right , mostly .  inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick .  at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver .  this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where " formula " isn't just business , it's a way of life .  the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits .  in some parts you can just hear them saying " more zany !  i want more zany here -- and -- here . "   " let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful .  i want the audience squirming in their seats . "   " ok , that's fine , but i want you to add bug guts . "   " what does this scene do ?  character depth ?  but where's the zaniness ?  i don't see zany here .  if you can't make it zany , cut it ! "  the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie .  michelle ( who plays penny , gadget's niece ) shines in every scene she's in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time .  my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor .  dabney coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby .  i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes .  he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the " gidget bitch from hell " town mayor .  oteri's overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon's own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn't poking fun at our fair town .  or , maybe all career politicians are like that .  i must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla .  he appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget .  rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw .  joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself .  her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film .  d . l . hughley plays the shuckin'-and-jivin' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years .  the dialog is . . . let's face it , it's pretty bad .  the tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context .  a lot of the lines ( especially hughley's ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib .  about three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw .  gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really " battles " ) with the evil gadget .  penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon .  let me rage here just for a minute .  michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character .  she's utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective .  why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery .  the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity .  inspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it's a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment .  probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits .  the " evil sidekick support group " is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it's onscreen .  all in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films .  i wonder if disney uses the revenues for it's generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers .  but if true , why ?  if they're trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it .  
1 this has been an extraordinary year for australian films .   " shine " has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards , picking up best film , best actor , best director etc . to that we can add the gritty " life " ( the anguish , courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and " love and other catastrophes " ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus ) .  i can't recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia .   " shine " was one bookend .  stand by for the other one : " dead heart " .  >from the opening credits the theme of division is established .  the cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names .  bryan | brown .  in a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby .  the local police officer has the task of enforcing " white man's justice " to the aboriginals .  these are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them .  naturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is " payback " .  an eye for an eye .  revenge .  usually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient's thigh .  brown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance .  he admits that he has to 'bend the rules' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal " payback " .   ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish ) .  the local priest - an aboriginal , but in the " white fellas " church - has a foot on either side of the line .  he is , figuratively and literally , in both camps .  ernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle .  he is part churchman and part politician .  however the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there .  whilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills .  he takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only .  she appears to not know this .  tony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place .  he then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art .  the community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it's payback time .  the fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered .  everyone is affected in the fall out .  to say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film .  suffice to say it's a rewarding experience .  bryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character .  his officer is real , human and therefore flawed .  brown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him .  it wasn't long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time .  the wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it's vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground .  the cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage .  at least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon 'invaders' : " jedda " , " the chant of jimmie blacksmith " and " the last wave " .  in a year when the race 'debate' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as " dead heart " .  the aboriginal priest best sums this up .  he is asked to say if he is a " black fella or white fella " .  
1 warning : contains what the matrix is .  rated r for sci-fi violence .  starring : keanu reeves , laurence fishburne , joe panteliano  some may be disappointed with the matrix .  i'll tell you i was .  i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen .  now wait wait , i know most of you loved it , and i'm not saying i didn't like it .  what i'm saying is the first half was extremely slow .  now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show .  don't be fooled , this movie has a big story .  and big chunks of talky moments .  but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par , deserving the rating above .  ok now to the story .  well this may take a while .  ok first of all , our world we live in now , is not the real world , actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix .  a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out , when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world .  he does so , and finds out that he can do anything , be anything he wants to be .  but he has to fight a 'matrix skipping' bad guy , who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him .  laurence fishburne , his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves .  but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were .  yeah there were some in the first half but not enough .  the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie .  now for the second half , it is explosive , and saves the movie .  some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking .  the sound , the music , and all the effects were effective , and the last hour kept us entertained .  but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes , this movie is at least 40 minutes too long .  one would have wished for a better 'matrix' , but i do have to say , i did like it and i was entertained .  
1 i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean's war picture .  i still think that it doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies .  and i think that lumet's " 12 angry men " , wilder's " witness for the prosecution " and kubrick's " paths of glory " would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958 .  but i can't deny the importance of " the bridge on the river kwai " - cinematically and in its contents .  the film is set in burma in 1943 .  a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai .  but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen .  struggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect .  afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge .  he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese .  but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . .  a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people .  they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge .  and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in " paths of glory " .  lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies .  this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito .  in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is a somehow unpleasant person in the film .  the audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not .  the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men .   ( the plot by-passes these risks . )  that means , the picture isn't perfect .  but it has a lot of virtues as well .  it shows the " madness " of war and what war can produce in people's minds .  it shows how col . nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics .  and " the bridge on the river kwai " is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests .  these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) .  david lean's effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense , especially in the dramatic ( though not wholly plausible ) showdown .  alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character .  the other actors deliver very good performances as well .  jack hildyard's fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful .  i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

1 i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn't .  george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again .  this is the first star wars film i've seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video .  what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals .  basically , the film's plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets .  qui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war .  when their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother .  qui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing .  anakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon's ship .  however , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy .  meanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit's end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders .  there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb .  this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made .  in all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes .  despite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws .  for starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience .  what a klutz !  george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain .  secondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie's atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments .  this is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie's plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here .  the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions .  i can't say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway .  however , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale .  natalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma .  there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance .  jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk .  despite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie .  the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn't quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite .  the film is a treasure to look at .  the visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius .  not since 1997's the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one .  the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick's 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang's classic silent metropolis .  however , all the sets are so original .  the original star wars movies can't even match the grandeur of this film's visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode .  the costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them .  whether its queen amadala's gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness .  the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie .  as for john williams' score , i don't think he's done one as complex or powerful since ? i can't even remember .  it is as epic as his schindler's list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws .  it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving .  what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed .  there is very little to hate in the film : it's a very accomplished and skillfully made flick .  it is the best " fun " film and the best big-budget film out today , most definitely .  
1 many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward .  most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors .  but little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell .  walking out of the theater , i could see the audience's disgust . . .  one member even had to be awakened after the film ended .  don't believe the previews that you see . . .  this is definitely not a film for everyone .  this is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years .  kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline .  the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us .  it goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries .  think of the film city of angels .  now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision .  both films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office .  costing around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it's money back .  but due to it's story , i doubt it will .  for everyone who thought titanic's story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well .  but don't get me wrong . . .  i hope the film does do well .  it's a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen .  i doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind .  what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals .  the only film that surpasses it is dark city .  full of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to .  but don't do that , because you'll end up going to hell .  what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake .  chris " christy " nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat .  annie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married .  annie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic .  chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself .  they also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock ) .  but one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie .  she tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution .  chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren't around anymore , and nothing will change that .  just as annie gets her life back in order , chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim .  chris goes to heaven , or his version of heaven , rather .  guided by albert ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy .  that is , until he realizes how miserable he is without annie .  prior to heaven , he would try to comfort annie , but the more he was around , the more pain she felt .  chris decides to leave her alone .  little does he realize what will happen next .  i'm not about to say , because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story ( many critics , however , give it away ) .  certainly , chris dying is crucial to the plot , but they tell you that he dies in the previews .  story is not necessarily important for this movie to work , because it deals with the afterlife .  however , strangely , virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil .  a couple of comments here and there , but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life .   " we're soul mates ! "  chris exclaims .  heaven , in movies , is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white , purity , and love .  usually , it also looks like it rests among the clouds .  but what dreams may come goes a different route .  it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before .  chris' heaven is his memories brought to life .  his thoughts can make anything real , and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven .   " i've never seen anyone use real paint before , " albert says .  equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone .  instead , it's a state of being .  in one gloriously horrific scene , chris and his " tracker " ( max von sydow ) arrive at a sea of faces .  thousands of heads are stuck above ground , their bodies somewhere else .  mostly dead silent , some quips are made , almost as if to lighten the mood .  it's truly a frightening sequence .  production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination .  using state of the art computer technology , worlds are created for exploration .  sometimes , some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact .  it's not necessary to be there , but we appreciate seeing it .  costume designer yvonne blake ( who also appears in the film ) has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes .  cinematographer eduardo serra , whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove , has a difficult job , as most cinematographers do working with special effects .  but serra's entire universe is a computer generated image , and he does a masterful job .  writer ron bass , adapting from the novel by richard matheson , provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot .  the story is extremely vague in its details , allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning .  and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision .  what dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience .  your average movie goer more than likely isn't used to expressionistic techniques .  the film will also definitely draw attention from religious people , but they shouldn't take it too far .  it is , after all , just a movie .  robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances , while his comedic roles have been suffering .  his comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff , but when is confined by a screenplay , he isn't quite as effective .  but drama is really his strong point , and you can see that here .  it's doubtful he'll get another oscar nomination , but i wouldn't really mind if he did .  the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land .  this may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention .  it's also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination .  however , the academy doesn't like to award performances for these types of films .  cuba gooding , jr . has been better , but he's certainly not distracting .  max von sydow is underused , as are jessica brooks and josh paddock .  a treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear ( if they even recognize him ) as chris' father lost in the sea of faces .  it's not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film , considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images .  overall , it's williams and sciorra's film .  what dreams may come is rated pg-13 for thematic elements involving death , some disturbing images , language , and some partial nudity .  the film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience .  some will find the plot distracting .  some will find the visuals absolutely glorious .  and some will find both .  the only real problem with the film , that i could see , was that it slows down considerably during the midsection , just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins .  by the way , some controversy even surrounded the title , which was mistaken for a sexual term ( " what " becomes " wet " and you should understand ) .  in actuality , the title is from a soliloquy in hamlet .  just thought i should let you know .  
0 five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there ( is this starting to sound familiar ? ) by mistake .  the girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one ( betcha didn't see that one coming ! ) .  hard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r . a . m . r . #1521 ) .  two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here .  orville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two ) .  yes , he is also built like a tank in this film too .  i'm telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn't harm him at all !  the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability .  thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film .  the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks .  any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line .  the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens .  there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot .  while we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress .  the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager's office .  i'm sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible ) .  the script for this film is completely pathetic .  the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible .  the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along .  here is an example of the wonderful dialog .  the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun .  the line is " my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it . "  this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy .  now , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented .  one comment from an actress is " not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it . "  i'm afraid folks that this is about as good as they get .  now lets talk about the great special effects for this film .  this obviously wasn't a big concern of the film makers .  the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer's intelligence .  a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie .  are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ?  the continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film .  in one shot , actress has cloths on , camera angle changes , actress seems to have lost clothing .  very impressive trick !  the one ( half ? )  plus that this film has going for it , is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious .  the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny , and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film .  however , this doesn't make it worth the rental fee of over a penny .  in the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down .  i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic , but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least .  oh well , win some , lose some .

"  with that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life .  lester works for an advertising agency .  his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering .  estranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress .  his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy .  carolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker .  she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings .  but inside she is desperate .  unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family .  the third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn's daughter .  a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction .  this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple .  not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her .  some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters .  most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts .  she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one .  colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man .  his rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham's .  in fact they are the next door neighbors .  anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in " american beauty " .  alan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series " cybil " and creator of the new sitcom " oh grow up " , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years .  not one character in this film rings falsely .  and the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful .  the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as " the graduate " or " lolita " .  kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances .  his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age .  finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth .  he quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year's salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet .  mr . spacey's performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees .  annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career .  carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy .  unable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder .  ms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone .  the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words .  thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her .  jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment .  her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning .  she is the prototypical trophy child .  when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( " i'm so proud of you , honey .  you didn't screw up once ! " ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable .  thora birch is a young actress to watch .  praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance .  colonel finn is a man in complete denial .  his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend .  wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma .  the boy next door who may be more foe than friend .  a deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him .  mr . bentley's performance is the one troublesome note in the film .  that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it .  director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle .  scenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character .  the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it's harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) .  every nuance of " american beauty " begs it's audience to think and examine .  it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come .  and well it should , as it is simply one of this years best .  
0  * * * warning - the following review contains spoilers * * *  cast : gary sinise , don cheadle , connie nielsen , jerry o'connell , kim delaney , tim robbins , elise neal , jill teed , jody thompson , bill timoney written by : jim thomas , john thomas and graham yost directed by : brian depalma running time : 115 minutes  the first big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything but .  gary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from a mars mission when his astronaut wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) , becomes ill and passes away .  don cheadle is then given the mission along with a russian couple and a young hotshot .  when a strange whirlwind shot from the top of a mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission , sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them , neilsen , and o'connell perform a rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining .  what they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever ( although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected ) .  before i ever saw the film , i was aware of the promotional campaign with dr . pepper .  every time i would see a bottle of the soft drink , the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it .  little did i know that the plot would be taking a back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products .  dr . pepper saves the day at one point , and a dream sequence/flashback features jerry o'connell shoving m&m's in our face .  these are but a couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film .  clich ? s are also the order of the day with mission to mars .  dialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day , which lifted all of it's premises from other sci-fi films was better than this film , and i don't like independence day ) .  films like 2001 : a space odyssey , the abyss , and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from ( and poorly at that ) .  there is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon , and i couldn't help but whisper " u'tinni " to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it .  this film also features one of my all-time least favorite movie clich ? s : the " he would have wanted you to have this " moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on ) .  scenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films , but in a film as clich ? ridden as this , it is particularly irritating .  ennio morricone's music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on , but here it is dreadfully overbearing .  his music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes .  at other times his music is unbearably over-dramatic .  one sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won't reach its intended target .  mission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme .  events are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience .  we are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife , but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest .  what makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle , except to invoke an emotional response ( i could think of at least one way to save him , and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be " smarter " than i am ) .  during the finale , when we are finally introduced to the translucent , conehead , kitty-faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from , we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film ( just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn ) .  a brief history lesson about " where we came from " is proffered , then sinise is whisked away to be with " the rest of our people " ( he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that " this is a chance to step foot where no one else has " ) .  >from the press i've been seeing this film receive , it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater .  i'm sure the first weekend or two will be huge , but once word gets out people will stop going .  let's just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isn't hurt by the negativity this film is generating .  i'd venture to say it won't be worse than this waste of time .

1  " dangerous beauty " is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583 .  it is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness .  dealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff .  the director , marshall herskovitz , doesn't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation .  the film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe .  at this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce .  the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived .  however , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment .  the story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy ) .  unfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders couldn't get in .  veronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider .  after a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her .  however , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco's world , albeit not as his wife .  she decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite .  a courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied .  at one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants .  veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself .  once she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well .  she is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco .  their relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco's advances .  in many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love .   " love the love , not the man , " as her mother told her .   " dangerous beauty , " which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice .  it has multiple plot lines -- including veronica's adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france's military assistance in venice's battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing .  much of the film's success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role .  known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson's ire in " braveheart " ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady .  she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes .  the rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in " dark city " have assured him a solid place in hollywood .  he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas .  oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy .  platt is a good actor , but he's just too hard to hate .  jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco's uncle .   " dangerous beauty " is marshall herskovitz's sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film " jack the bear . "  partnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( " thirtysomething , " " my so-called life " ) and in the movies ( " legends of the fall " ) .  his directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions .  he could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids .   " dangerous beauty " contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative .  herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly-stylized thriller " kalifornia " ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara's dark sci-fi film " body snatchers " ( 1994 ) .  bazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth-century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery .  however , the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( " brazil , " " the princess bride " ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( " the age of innocence " ) .  the only problem with " dangerous beauty " is that it doesn't stick with you .  it's a good story well-told with interesting characters , but it's easy to shrug off once you've left the theater .  the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions , but it never quite comes off because it's simply too melodramatic and conventional .  herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter , but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion , and like the rest of the film , it carries no real weight , despite the potential severity of the subject matter .  
1 he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother .  she inspires his love and his fear , and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus .  he has a rudimentary grasp of language , mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother's phrases .  he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous ; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door .  he is 35-years-old in body , but a child in mind and spirit .  he is the premise for bad boy bubby , a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby ( nicholas hope ) who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , etc . , etc . then one day his father ( ralph cotterill ) appears .  his father is a shabby down-at-heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion .  unsurprisingly , he is not thrilled with the way " his " boy has turned out .  he is , however , rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother ( claire benito ) , and , more to the point , her ample breasts .  soon they are copulating on the dingy couch , while bubby crouches , confused , in the next room , acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest .  bubby's relationship to the world may be warped , but it is at least stable .  the father's arrival disturbs his precarious balance , causing an oedipal conflict which ends--freud would be pleased--in violence and , as a result , freedom .  bubby intuits from his father's arrival that the air outside is breathable : he leaves the apartment , his past , his world , behind .  so far , so good .  the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby , which bring us to this point , are quite brilliant .  the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby's hermetic two-room universe .  it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise : bubby is used by his mother for sex , he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane , he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins .  it is grim and savage and appalling , but also strangely tender--de heer , having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby's , does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes , but simply empathizes .  he observes what it might be like .  the intensity of these opening scenes , with their minimalist mise-en-scene , immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world , and owes much to david lynch's eraserhead , not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack .  for thirty minutes , the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own .  then de heer lets bubby out , brings him into contact with our world , and the film never quite recovers .  our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide , where he wanders the streets and meets people , where he suffers and learns and survives .  he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band ( how an anti-social half-wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages , wisely ) ; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress ; he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach ; he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group ; he is imprisoned and raped ; he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension ; he is loved by a motherly large-breasted nurse ( carmel johnson ) .   .   .  it goes on , by turns inventive , silly , tasteless , endearing , and sometimes all of these things at once .  de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world : the tone shifts , uneasily , from fable to realism to satire and back again .  the scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest ; the film is best understood as a kind of parable , and , indeed , the religious implications of bubby's experiences are foregrounded : icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother's walls , bubby dons a priest's collar stolen from his father , a church organ-playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief , the woman who redeems him is named angel .  the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby's mind , do not fragment him into psychosis ; rather , the world accomodates him , and heals him .  although de heer's touch is at times overbearing , bubby's salvation is touching ; what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na ? ve humanist tale of improbable hope .  a hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community .  he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman , turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art , and turning the band into a popular draw .  innocence triumphs .  bubby becomes a holy fool , an idiot savant , and graces us with wisdom .  it's a strange turn of events , but by now we shouldn't be surprised , because bad boy bubby ain't like other movies .  
1 note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .   " all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts " - excerpt from as you like it , act ii , scene 7  when william shakespeare penned this passage , he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent , or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash .  this is the world of today , and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like the truman show .  truman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life .  he has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise .  or so it would seem .  bizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman's life .  a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky .  a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term 'isolated' follows him around .  a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move .  for the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be .  the truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next .  balancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy .  in many ways , mr . niccol's screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea .  although the film's rather conventional climax doesn't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception .  despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible .  the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false .  the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs .  the system formula .  while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking .  the device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman's growing awareness isn't exactly convincing .  there's not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film .  in fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman's artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling .  still , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city .  i've always believed that the versatile ms . linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans .  cheerfully going over the top , it's hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she'd have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ?  ms . linney is a delight in the film .  but it is mr . carrey who rules the show here .  he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it's difficult not to root for truman .  in a commanding performance , mr . carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there's an early scene where he's down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr . carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags .  it's almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who's constantly the centre of attention .  in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman's antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz's original score .  technical credits are first-rate all around .  while the truman show is clearly a definitive high-concept film , it's not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound , ranging from 1965's secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner .  all the same , this is a visionary , award-calibre film : entertaining , provocative , and intelligent .  the curious ( and possibly disturbing ) thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film's concept seems unfathomably outrageous , it's abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching , if not actualisation , at least permissiveness of such a scenario .  perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr . weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question .  perhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world .  
0 what are we going to do with jim carrey ?  viewers of television's " in living color " know this one-man cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill .  viewers also know that " in living color " is a skit-show and that a little of jim carrey goes a long way .  unfortunately , this fact was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedy ace ventura : pet detective .  three writers , including carrey , worked on the slapstick story , which sends a self-styled " pet detective " on the trail of a stolen dolphin .  the missing mammal belongs to the miami dolphins , who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl .  for plot porpoises , this story works as well as any three stooges short .  carrey gets to do his " official " schtick as he snoops around greater miami .  he leers and sneers , craning his neck to funny effect .  he even does his captain kirk impersonation .  again .  all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you realize that the writers have absolutely no intention of focusing on anyone * other * than carrey .   ( suggested alternate title--jim carrey : will do anything for a laugh . )  export it to france and you may have a hit .  as it stands , ace ventura isn't even good kid's stuff .  the profanity count , alone , is too high .  which is ironic , since children are , probably , carrey's best audience .  the film doesn't even have the goofball charm of chris elliott's recent no-brainer cabin boy .  sure , carrey has his moments .  but what can you say about a film whose high-points include watching carrey slink around to the theme from " mission impossible ? "  ace ventura has one glaring incongruity .  amid the butt-jokes and double-takes , the script takes great pains to set-up an elaborate and rather funny " crying game " gag .  and , for * this * intended audience , that takes ( ahem ) cojones .  
0 the u . s . army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done .  one particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting .  under the " saluting " section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer .  the salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail .  in any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group .  almost at the very beginning of the general's daughter , we see a general's motorcade passing a work detail .  everyone salutes .  it looked impressive , but it just wasn't right .  that little bit showed me that someone either didn't do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene .  in fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie .  what results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn't right .  the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example .  paul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army's criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale .  prior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn't the unscrupulous supply sergeant he's supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living .  so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we'll just say that it involves propellers ) .  brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general's daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base's training ranges .  he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder .  what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary .  it gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he's a little cocky .  does the arms subplot turn up later ?  no , so why add this extra running time to the film ?  the answer : it looked cool .  or how about the " atmosphere " ?  the beginning of the general's daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music .  nice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn't matter , for when the film's plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood .  no attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme .  did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ?  instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside .  the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie .  as i've already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn't jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty .  brenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest " yes , sir " s i've ever heard .  he even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general's daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous .  sunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity .  both characters are protagonists , but it's hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing .  i could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , " let's do it again , but this time , i want more . "  i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes .  an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general's aide , colonel fowler .  i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention .  a far cry from his days as linc in " the mod squad " , i can't help but think he was acting from west's direction .  a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear .  the only two actors who seem to have escaped west's influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth's mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police .  woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people's minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top .  hutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn't overacting .  i haven't read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i'll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form .  the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished .  every time we're presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it's the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all .  instead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead .  the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was .  would've been over in a half hour .  the film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning .  literally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off .  they both seem kind of happy .  maybe they were driving away from simon west .  
1 in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something .  it angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up .  it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film .  having endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about .  does men live up to its press ?  well , yes it does .  and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office .  for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment .  chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business .  chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder .  howard is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent .  we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge .  there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her .  the reason ?  both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex .   " it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , " he says .  howard , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan .  they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp .  chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner .  howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate .  flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both .  you can guess which one she falls for .  soon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him .  adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ?  in chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls .  his evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile .  we watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart .  his character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him .  he's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness .  if one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind .  politics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground .  men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory .  the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe .  the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril .  could it happen in the real world ?  probably not .  taken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society .  maybe it's just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience .  the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive .  the marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way .  but does the film work as entertainment ?  its darned funny in spots , particularly in the men's room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions .  it works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers .  stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her .  likewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions .  by the end of the film you'll feel as if you've met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film .  certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed .  but the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time .  like all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world .  while watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn't help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs .  there may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art .  
1 an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well-worn material .  the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation .  instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice .  upon arriving , she tells her self-centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she'll be home in a few days .  of course , that doesn't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries .  in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) .  rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando .  i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips .  but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread .  ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world .  throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz's character .  the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop -- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up .  director and co-writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor .  the cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress won't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job .  the reason ?  mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories .  the novice detective's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny .  unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips' cheery tone .  rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt .  it's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie .  several details in fernando's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies .  early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door .  after that , fernando's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando's stormy past .  it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesn't need any .  but there aren't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips .  the movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we'd like to live if we had the nerve . . .  or if our passports weren't missing .  
0 when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain , you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie .  however , since this film also featured michael madsen , more than capable character actor , this time in the role of protagonist , the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt .  however , the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials - madsen plays richard montana , tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio ( played by lynch ) .  however , the raid was only partially successful , and montana is getting the rap .  so , he begins his own private war against gio , trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt .  in the process , he meets gio's mistress gina zamora ( played by rosie vela ) and starts relationship with her too .  although it doesn't stink like many of the similar films can , inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine .  nobody in this film actually puts much effort , including madsen or lynch , and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke .  the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela , who , apart from showing her more than impressive looks , shows some of the singing talent too .  however , this isn't reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would , in most likelihood , forget the next day .  
0 movies can do the two big es very well : educate and entertain .  in the best of all possible worlds , they accomplish both .  on the red planet , they fail entirely .  in the near future , a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth .  this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be .  after some mumbo-jumbo about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet , the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does .  the ground crew of people you couldn't care less about is trapped on the surface without food , water or air and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog .  the one potentially interesting character ( carrie-anne moss ) spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a computer .  attempting to graft " 2001 " esque space mysticism with " terminator " robot horror , first time director antony hoffman can't seem to figure out what's going on .  neither can we .  didn't he have anyone who could step back from the shooting and make sure there was a coherent story ?  couldn't he have used the money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter ?  there are so many mis-steps .  every opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction .  why introduce the theme of faith vs . science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die _offscreen_ ?  the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen .  two hours later , they're still waiting .  despite our greatest hopes , there is no life on the red planet .  
0 the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film .  it's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction .  that , however , is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller .  the punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general's daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense .  our hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u . s . army's criminal investigation division .  his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation .  complicating the case is the fact that capt . campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice-presidential nominee .  general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in .  teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough , once had a romantic relationship with brenner -- brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain's past that make the case ever more sordid .  if only the sordidness were the worst of the general's daughter's problems .  scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze .  director simon west likely thinks he's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film's fatal flaw .  it's a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story's few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them .  characters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell's still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans .  west just can't help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general's daughter .  he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits .  bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell .  the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell's mentor , a psychological warfare expert named moore ( james woods ) .  there's something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another .  indeed , travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures ( to the local sheriff of the georgia county : " shouldn't you be out night-sticking the colored folk ? " ) .  even the lame device of brenner and sunhill's sexual history provides a few winning zingers .  goldman's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you'll find in most so-called comedies .  dialogue , unfortunately , just isn't enough to make a quality script .  it's difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye ) .  by the time the general's daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun .  it's silly and pretentious film-making , but at least it provides a giggle or five .  goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine .  
0 you know the plot : a dimwit with a shady past is seduced into committing a crime only to be double-crossed by a fatal femme .  in " palmetto , " the dimwit is harry barber ( woody harrelson ) , a reporter who's just been released from prison ( he was framed by the gangsters and corrupt officials he was investigating ) .  enter la femme : rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , the sexy young wife of the richest man in palmetto , florida ( rolf hoppe ) .  she and her stepdaughter odette ( chlo ? sevigny ) have a plot to extort 500k from the old man : harry will " kidnap " odette .  after groping both women , harry agrees .  as everyone except harry can see , he's being set up as a fall guy .  sure enough , before long , harry has a dead body in his trunk and the cops on his tail .  his brother-in-law ( tom wright ) , an assistant da , has hired harry to be the press liaison for the case , so harry gets a front row seat for his own manhunt ( and we get to watch him sweat-literally ) .  there are several plot twists , of course-a couple of them even took me by surprise .  apparently every woman in palmetto is a raving horndog , and they're on harry like he's the only bone in the kennel .  shue vamps so broadly that i expected tex avery's wolf to show up .  her incredible performance in " leaving las vegas " seems to have been a fluke .  here , she could easily be mistaken for melanie griffith .  shue's character is supposed to be a savvy schemer but she comes off as a brainless bimbo .  in addition to shue and sevigny , the kennel includes gina gershon ( who filled the dimwit-with-a-shady-past role in " bound " ) as harry's girlfriend nina ; when harry gets out of jail , she licks his face ( now there's a horndog ) .  the parts are so overplayed that with a little push " palmetto " could have been an over-the-top parody of film noir a la " romeo is bleeding . "  as it is , it's best watched at 2am on showtime ( the love scenes seem to have been written for one of that channel's soft porn programs anyway ) .   " palmetto " has a well-known director , volker schl ? ndorff , who's best known for his adaptations of major literary works , especially " the tin drum . "  i suppose he must have been drawn to this plot-by-numbers script by the same admiration for classic film noir that led scorsese to remake " cape fear . "  schl ? ndorff tries hard-he makes an interesting motif out of the ubiquitous palmetto bugs-but nothing can freshen up this stale script .  
0  " there's nothing new under the sun " is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means " let's find something to copy . "  of course there are very few completely original ideas .  even earth-shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience .  there is , after all , no need to re-invent the wheel time after time .  recently it seems that hollywood doesn't feel the need to even re-write the script .  my understanding of the word " sequel " is a continuation of the story .  the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes .  have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalma's adaptation of the steven king novel ?  this is your dream come true .  rachel ( emily bergl ) , a high school outcast , is beginning to notice weird things happening around her .  doors slam shut by themselves .  glass globes blow up .  her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent .  a popular boy unexpectedly asks her out .  the in-crowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event .  any of this sound familiar ?  once the audience catches on that this is the same story as " carrie " , there's little to do but wait for the inevitable ending .  the effects are a bit better this time around , but the film doesn't work nearly as well .  there are a couple of minor plot differences .  rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized .  the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original .  they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest .  and , uh , there must be other story changes but none stand out .  one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell .  over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie .  now a high school counselor , she befriends rachel , but her character's potential is squandered .  there's too much about sue that doesn't make sense .  after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates , sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachel's mother is in .  still living in the same small town , the woman with a well-known history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor ?  sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease .  this may be the one original idea in the film , but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a " disease " is never explained .  sue's eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldn't figure out what to do with her .  blink and you'll miss it .  some of the events are filmed in black and white , but the rationale for this is unknown .  it doesn't add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random .   " the rage " retains some of the trappings of " carrie " without the meaning .  in the first film the color red was a motif connected to carrie's onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating .  here there's an abundance of red , but for no apparent purpose .  the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin .  one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds .  the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original .  seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film - and the flaws in this one .  
1 in 1995 , brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept : the audience isn't stupid .  from that , they went on and created the most plot-driven , intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years .  the result : the usual suspects , one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist .  the story is convoluted , and is really confusing to read , although easy to follow on screen .  special investigator kujan ( chazz palminteri ) grills " verbal " kint ( kevin spacey ) , a crippled con-man who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims .  kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis , the rogue cop keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , is actually dead .  kint relates the majority of the film in flashback , beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a police-station lineup in new york city .  along with dour keaton , kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , mordantly sarcastic hockney ( kevin pollak ) , and fenster ( benicio del toro ) , whose speech is virtually incomprehensible .  together they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from " new york's finest taxi service " --crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins .  what follows is a shell-game of violence and betrayal , all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze .  the film is brilliantly compact : its the shortest 90 minutes you'll ever spend in a movie theater .  the cast is exceptional .  palminteri shines , he is brutally honest , a true cop , one who is going after the whole story because its there .  byrne is terrific , his brooding character , his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro , who is a riot as fenster .  del toro is brilliant , his lines are a jumbled mess , you can't understand a word the man says , but it sure is damn funny .  baldwin is also very good , he is careful , methodical , and cold , a chilling character with a nasty streak of hot-blooded sarcasm .  pollak is also terrific as usual , a very good character actor .  however , this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey .  spacey is simply breathtaking , he is a force on screen , giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze .  spacey's performance will be remembered for years , for it is the best of his career , it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last 50 years .  verbal kint is a clever storyteller , weak , oppressed , and gleefully evil to the bone , yet pitiful , one who draws sympathy .  the film is a good one , a decent film until the last 10 minutes .  what this film boils down to is the greatest ending in cinematic history , for me at least .  the revelation of keyser soze , the closing gunfights , it is something wondrous .  you have to see this movie about 10 times to believe what they do .  kudos to mcquarrie and singer for giving the audience a delightful , fast-paced , furiously plot-driven movie with quirky characters , phenomenal acting , and some hilarious moments stuck in the middle .  mcquarrie refuses to believe the audience is dumb .  without furnishing too many details , he concocts his story and lets it run , hoping the audience gets it at the end .  we do .  this might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created .  kudos also to singer and john ottman , who created the score .  they both create what is a true film-noir setting , carefully setting up this intricate puzzle until the final , jarring ending .  there are flaws : more questions raised than answers , lack of character development , and no strong female characters ( save one ) .  however , the plot , and that stunning ending , make up for all the flaws and more .  if you haven't seen the movie , rent it .  watch it .  then rewind the tape , and watch it again .  trust me , you'll be amazed .  
0 one of my brother's favorite movies is h . b . halicki's 1974 cult flick " gone is sixty seconds , " one of the best products of the car-chase genre that provided drive-in fare during the 1970's .  chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue , but they had a strong visceral appeal .  although it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars , the remake of " gone in sixty seconds " is relatively weak and dull .  randall " memphis " raines ( nicolas cage ) is a retired car thief who runs a go-cart track .  he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip ( giovanni ribisi ) would not take up boosting cars .  however , kip became a thief anyway , and now he's in big trouble .  kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri ( christopher eccleston ) by the end of the week .  calitri expects memphis to fulfill kip's bargain ; if he doesn't come through , kip dies .  memphis gathers his old crew ( angelina jolie , robert duvall , will patton , chi mcbride , and vinnie jones ) , and kip brings his boys ( t . j .  cross , william lee scott , scott caan , and james duval ) .  as if calitri breathing down their necks wasn't bad enough , the team is pursued by a cop ( delroy lindo ) who's still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster ( rap star master p ) who wants to take over calitri's clients .  watching " gone , " i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one .  maybe that's why the first forty-nine are fairly easy , and the thrills are saved for " eleanor , " a 1967 shelby gto , a model that has always eluded memphis .  but the big chase doesn't live up to the long wait .  i had high hopes for " gone " because it is director dominic sena's second film .   " kalifornia , " his 1993 debut , was a brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience .  in that movie sena took a simple thriller plot ( a couple gives a serial killer a ride ) and successfully endowed it with deeper significance .  in " gone " he seems to be aiming for a drama about two brothers who can't communicate with each other , but that goal just doesn't mesh with this plot .   " gone " either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough .  it's not light enough to be fun , or mean enough to be intense .  this chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it .  the lack of action is a waste of the premise , which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever .  the weak script is a waste of a talented cast .  in a " newsweek " interview last year , sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies .  much as i like cage , for every good picture he does ( " leaving las vegas , " " bringing out the dead " ) , there are two major stinkers ( " snake eyes , " " con air , " " 8mm , " " city of angels " ) .  that ratio is probably better than what a lot of his peers can boast , but cage has real talent .  it's a shame to waste it in glitzy , superficial tripe like " gone in 60 seconds .

1 tarzan chad'z = good ) 1999 , g , 90 minutes [1 hour , 30 minutes] [animated - adventure/drama] starring the voices of : tony goldwyn ( tarzan ) , minnie driver ( jane porter ) , lance henriksen ( kerchak ) , brian blessed ( clayton ) ; written by tab murphy , bob tzudiker , noni white ; produced by bonnie arnold ; directed by chris buck , kevin lima ; based on the story `tarzan of the apes' and characters created by edgar rice burroughs .  seen july 4 , 1999 at 7 : 15 p . m . at crossgates cinemas 18 ( guilderland , ny ) , theater #9 , by myself for free using my hoyts season pass .  [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture and seats]  title : `tarzan' beautiful to look at , easy to follow .  review : disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to be interested and at least entertained by the story .  the basic premise is the same as every other `tarzan' story : a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really understanding ( or even noticing ) that he's human and is a lot different from the animals he befriends .  the first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala ( voiced by glen close ) , a female gorilla who lost her own child in a classic case of darwanism .  her mate , kerchak ( henriksen ) , is a mean , conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up tarzan's extended family .  he refuses to acknowledge tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz during the childhood scenes ) as a son and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually does dangerous , wild things that are the result of his own childish instincts .  i have a feeling children will quickly be able to identify with tarzan since all he really is is just a kid who wants to have fun and it's funny how the adults fail to comprehend this .  later , as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a full-grown man ( voiced by goldwyn ) , he is encounter by a party of three humans from england : jane porter ( driver ) , a beautiful woman who is something of a zoologist and an artist , her father prof . archimedes q . porter ( voiced by nigel hawthorne ) who is also a scientist ; and their slick and cunning , yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton ( blessed ) .  it's easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the screenplay doesn't seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for children's enjoyment .  sure there's a lot of cliche stuff here , like clayton's smugness and diabolical manipulation of tarzan and jane ; the goofy supporting characters ( voiced by rosie o'donnell [in full brooklyn accent ! ] and wayne knight - `hello newman ! ' ) .  there's also a lot of fun action such as tarzan's swinging through the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks .  it's just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks ( those mcdonald's commercials really prove this point ) .  ultimately , you get exactly out of `tarzan' what you expect . . .  and i mean that as a compliment , so have high expectations .  pros : animation and sound are a feast for the senses , story is lighthearted , breezy and not dumbed-down , no stupid sing-along songs to get stuck in your head .  cons : surprisingly violent , should have been rated pg .  young children may not understand some of the more adult themes ( parents , be ready to have some heavy questions thrown your way ) .  running time is a bit short .  would you recommend this to friends ?  not to my friends , but to the movie-going public i would .  score : or with no 0 rating ) .  
1 sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film .  sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride .  i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes .  surprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say .  but by the attentiveness of the crowd i'd say they were won over - as was i . i can't tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year .  time alone will make that call .  but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank's side .  we were concerned for his well-being , and wanted him to win .  that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last .  the truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot .  unless you're under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics .  carrey stars as truman burbank , a capra-esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner's idea of the perfect american small town .  truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co-workers .  there is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good .  but then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky .  this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world's biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world's most popular television program .  what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir .  the soundstage , we're told , is " only the second man-made structure visible from space . "  truman's movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams .  weir cuts the film so we're never quite sure if we're watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show's omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man-made moon in seahaven's sky .  the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence .  his best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him .  his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product .  he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town .  one wonders why he didn't pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : " people tend to accept the reality with which they're presented . "  nevertheless , truman begins to grow restless , and dreams of escape to fiji , where an old college sweetheart ( natasha mcelhone ) supposedly lives .  this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way .  by underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over .  there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon , and marlon answers with best-friend sincerity , " i'd gladly step in front of a bus for you . "  but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof .  the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home - and from that moment , we're on his side .  the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies - haven't we all , at least once , doubted our place in the world , doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ?  ultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator .  what does god really think of us ?  does he resent our abandonment of paradise ?  who exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ?  if you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work .  as for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play .  carrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn't try to be .  he just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us .  
0 by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer , it's possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one .  action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup .  audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film's sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop-out .  somewhere out there , maybe there's a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate sphere's dubious charms , but i'm not among them .  i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it's hard to understand why the rights were optioned .  sphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create .  with expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson/dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) ,  something this bad can't help but look even worse .  the last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year's batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received .  sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron's the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon .  science and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere's first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences .  attempts at characterization fall apart .  intelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel .  special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness .  but all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful .  this is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect .  i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film .  there is some promise , but it's all in the setup .  we're introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered .  when one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee .  on the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission .  together , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact .  for a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation .  the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities .  then , right around the one-hour mark ( that's the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever's left of titanic ) , the virtually non-stop action begins , and , once it starts , the script becomes superfluous .  this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but , instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things " exciting . "  additionally , because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who's more interested in technology than people ) , viewers don't develop much of a rooting interest .  it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience .  what about that a-list cast ?  not surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn't a person ; he's a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue .  dustin hoffman isn't lively or particularly good -- it's ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) .  sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat .  their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective .  then there's queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count .  i like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere's lengthy pre-production phase ) .  if that's the case , forgiveness is granted .  i'm less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind ) .  even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton's credit as a producer disallows him absolution .  he was a willing participant in a creative travesty .  no wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year's cinematic wasteland .  it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth-consecutive weekend atop the box office heap .  
0 arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar , go to the movies , fall in love , move in together , etc .  review ======  well , if you haven't seen when harry met sally or he said , she said , or if you don't watch love & war on television , you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages .  however , if you've seen any of these , than you have seen most of this film .  this of course doesn't mean its bad .  some of it is amusing , but overall , i just had to ask what's the point ?  arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love .  kevin pollack is the stereotypical female-fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes , most if which weren't very funny .  couteney cox is the stereotypical career-minded woman who falls in love .  julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman .   ( notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical .  this film uses a lot of formula , the plot is basically known from the opening credits . )  so what is good about the movie ?  well as i said there are a few amusing moments .  surprisingly , julie brown , who i usually find just plain goofy , was the best thing in the film .  also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual .  gee , this is really short .  not much to say about the film really .  it is just kind of there .  watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time , but i wouldn't recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre .  
1 with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the " film noir " genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller's crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) .  their latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film .  the main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world , but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax .  that main character is jeffrey " the dude " lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film's rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as " quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . "  the dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who's in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody's cheating in a bowling match ( " has the whole world gone crazy ? ! " he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who's always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( " donny , you have no frame of reference here ! " ) .  these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of " hotel california " and , if it's possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter .  if that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude's rug .  they've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the " big " lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) .  the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn't have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom .  unfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude's car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money .  soon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german " nihilists " who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn .  meanwhile , the big lebowski's daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family .  the plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc .  the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival's " run through the jungle , " and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) .  the film doesn't feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude's dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact .  the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this " jungle " but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution .  there's also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his " this aggression will not stand " speech .  the coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( " the bums will always lose ! "  shouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their " peaceful beach community , " and so on .  by the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least " aggression " of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on " passive , " albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters .  he also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn't like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he's getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end .  the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don't just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either .  i think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained .  audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first .   " it's good knowin' he's out there , the dude , takin' it easy , " posits the narrator towards the end .  i dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken .  
0 there's a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book " screenwriting made easy . "  this is funny the first time just 'cause it is , but funnier as the film goes on since it's totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it , outlined it and then wrote this film .  it's like they took the sub-genre of the disaster pic , which can be fun and hokey at the same time , and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them : the stupid , eccentric characters .  yes , " the poseidon adventure " is crap , but it's fun 'cause of all the stupid , eccentric characters .  and " earthquake , " my god !   " earthquake " has got to be one of the worst movies of all time , but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold .   " volcano " takes a semi-intriguing yet stupendously inane plot ( a volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops . . . only  it's in , dare i say it ?  l . a ! ! ! ) and then puts no stupid , stereotypical , eccentric characters in it .  they're just stupid .  and the actors are all good ones .  tommy lee jones is great , an oscar winner , and a member of the men in black ( my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer ) .  anne heche is a good indy actress .  don cheadle stole the disappointing " devil in a blue dress " from denzel's feet .  and gaby's one of the few good teenage actors .  but they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what's going on .  they do their best , god bless them , but they're all lost in the fake magma ( only don cheadle gets an interesting part and he's the greatest part of the film ) .  there's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone .  i actually was rooting for gaby's character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn't have to keep saving her ( he did it like thirty times ! ) .  and there are no interesting sites in l . a . that we see get destroyed .  part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever .  in " independence day , " the best part ( other than judd hirsch ) was watching the white house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens .  that was cool .  watching really fake-looking magma plow down the street is not .  okay , so the film's not devoid of merit .  as i already stated , don cheadle was great and the cast does their best .  and there's this really moronic scene which looks cool .  john carrol lynch ( norm from " fargo " ) goes on a subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it .  he has one guy who's wounded and could make it .  he could throw the guy and jump and still survive .  but no ! ! !  he has to go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava .  here's the cool sight : he melts .  here's the dumb part of it : he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting .  cool sight .  no logic .  but cool sight .  the volcano erupts twice and for some reason , the film ends there .  they aren't worried about it eruting again , they just go home to their toppled homes .  but to tell the truth , i was glad they didn't go on .  i was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended .  my god , it was actually painful to sit through this little 102 minute long film .  i haven't seen " dante's peak " but i've heard it's a masterpiece compared to this .  if you want to see a cool disaster flick that's inane but interesting , rent " the towering inferno " with steve mcqueen , paul newman , and the schweppervescent o . j .  simpson ( he saves a cat ) .  if you want to waste your time watching a boring , stupid disaster flick ( literally , it almost grossed half of its budget ) , see this .  but i warned you .  
1 the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/director/producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director , he really is .  he wrote this film , he directed this film , he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film .  i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it's popularity or it's ability to scare the wits out of people .  i think i have seen 'halloween' over 100 times and each time i find something new and brilliant , and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen .  i own three different versions of the film : a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary t-shirt , a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re-mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation , in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow-globe .  in other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film .  it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only 2 , 4 , and 7 being truly good .  it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan .  since i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of 30 , 000 copies , i knew i had to buy one no matter what !  i did and man to me it's the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film .  no words can describe the dvd .  in 'halloween' michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood 16 years ago in 1963 .  now in 1978 grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield , illinois , followed by his past doctor sam loomis .  the person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut .  why is he stalking her ?  check out halloween ii it explains it all .  on this unholy night on october 31 , 1978 laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives , which is trying to stay alive .  the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk .  nick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job , and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did .  what john carpenter did in 1978 is made a ground-breaking new film , with scares , wit , and style .  the movie is flawless if not perfect .  no other movie or sequel has lived up to this one , and in my opinion never will .  'halloween' will be like 'psycho' and still be extremely popular even almost 40 years later .  i just hope someday 'halloween' will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the 4 extra scenes on the dvd edition .  'halloween' isn't just another slice-and-dice horror flick , it's an intelligent , horrifying and best film experience ever made .  see 'halloween' and be scared . . . . then  watch it again !  reviewed by brandon herring october 7 , 1999 .  
0 an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices .  that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow .  that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source .  the acting in particular i found very good , the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie .  a few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone , yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better .  on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot .  the character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing .  as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener .  all these people acted their parts admirably , as for the part that sharon stone played , she played it well but the part was not utilized enough .  the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie , this is one of those occasions .  matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ) .  there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this .  the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing , the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it .  i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it .  all in all i found this movie boring and very slow , the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch .  although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them .  i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie .  
0 who knew that in 16 years eddie murphy , who made such a brash , raucous big-screen splash in _48_hrs . _ ,  would become . . .  cuddly .  the disconcerting trend begun in this summer's cutesy , largely laugh-free _doctor_dolittle_ continues with this earnest-to-a-fault dramedy .  although he is top-billed , here murphy is merely support for jeff goldblum , who plays ricky hayman , the programming director at a home shopping network .  sales are way down , and ricky's job hangs by a thread until he meets g ( murphy ) , a mysterious spiritual guru whom a desperate ricky puts on the air .  while sales skyrocket and g becomes an overnight sensation , the reinvigorated ricky's greed grows , endangering his budding romance with a goodhearted media research consultant ( kelly preston ) .  writer tom schulman has some promising ideas , satirizing home shopping and infomercials and the nature of instant celebrity .  but these ideas would have more bite if stephen herek had invested any energy into the direction of the film .  the sluggishly paced _holy_man_ is not only slow and overlong ( 113 minutes ) , but an unfunny bore , and murphy can do little to juice up the proceedings ; cleansed of both the attitude _and_ comic sensibility that made him a star ( g is , for the most part , a straight man ) , he is a curiously lifeless presence .  goldblum is actually quite good , but it's hard for the audience to sustain much interest in his character and spiritual journey when the director doesn't seem to be much interested , either .  
1 for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend , there are certain rules that he needs to follow .  firstly , fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship .  secondly , buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes .  thirdly , find the perfect moment and location to propose .  finally , the groom-wannabe should probably get her parent's blessing .  of these four , the last one can be a nightmare .  meeting parents is a rite of passage , fraught with unexpected questions , bouts of nervousness , the reality of being disliked , and the inability to make a positive impression .  if you're lucky , things will go smoothly .  but , if you're greg focker ( ben stiller ) , everything will go wrong .  and with a name like that , how could it not ?  when greg first meets his fianc ? e's father , jack byrnes ( the grimacing robert deniro ) , greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive .  when he tells jack that he's a male nurse , the incorrigible dad shoots back , " not many men in your profession , huh , greg ? "  it's definitely not a good start .  but greg is determined to win him over , and it's this desire that fuels the movie .  he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner .  it doesn't matter that he's jewish .  if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace , then that's what he's going to gamely do .   " oh god . . . you're  such a good god " , he moons .  his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle , but when jack gives him the " deniro squint " ( that familiar , unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility ) , it's pretty hard not to grin .  things get progressively worse for greg .  and that's too bad because he's a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart .  eventually , he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up , committing a host of gaffes that embarrass , humiliate or injure other people .  it's a never-ending ordeal of missteps , miscues , and mistakes .  he buys some champagne , but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances .  he tries to find jack's missing cat .  but his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble .  and there are several other episodes , each one trumping the next in outrageousness .  the more our well-meaning beau screwed up , the more the audience groaned in sympathy .  we liked greg .  and , we liked this movie .   " meet the parents " is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments .  just sit back and watch greg get into trouble .  no matter what the situation , whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house , things will horribly go wrong .  we laugh at greg's expense , but love often makes a person do dumb things , and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool .  deniro is also affable , tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside .  their tug-of-war is often funny , the slapstick is elaborate , and there are several topical throwaway gags ( mostly targeted at the airline industry ) to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future in-laws from hell .  
1 whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms .  he made the west dirty in " mccabe and mrs . miller " ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in " the long goodbye " ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with " popeye " ( 1980 ) .  the same holds true for his most recent film , " the gingerbread man , " which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie .  by the time " the gingerbread man " was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham .  there's no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn't feature a great showdown in a courtroom .  instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , " the gingerbread man " is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman's trademark full-frontal female nudity .  the central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham's other lawyer heroes .  he is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds .  rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) .  a reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn't hard to surmise that rick's womanizing had a large part in it .  whenever he's late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it's because he's been " screwing around . "  after an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn't lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses .  he drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together .  rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers .  it was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does " weird " stuff like that .  as another character puts it , dixon is " a few beers short of six-pack . "  rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency .  he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory's begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) .  dixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out .  from there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double-crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action .  altman's cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look .  if it isn't night-time , at least it's raining .  gu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light .  a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability .  in the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world .  altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies .  but , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings .   " the gingerbread man " is no different , although his style is much more restrained here .  however , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller .  a great deal of the credit for the film's success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction .  here , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic .  rick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character .  without it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick's pain and frustration .  the supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart-breaking role as the jewish maid in " schindler's list " ( 1993 ) .  tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird .  it doesn't seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film's one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing .  while " the gingerbread man " isn't in league with altman's greatest works like " nashville " ( 1975 ) or " the player " ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career .  some critics love to stamp films like this as " commercial , " as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don't make money .  altman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more .  
1 steve soderbergh's " sex , lies , and videotape , " which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989 , arguably began the resurgence of independent films .  made on a shoestring budget of $1 . 2 million , with then relatively unknown actors , it is a provocative , thoroughly original drama .  the film mostly focuses on the four central characters , all in their late 20's-early 30's .  ann ( andie macdowell ) , an unfulfilled housewife , is married to john ( peter gallagher ) , an insensitive lawyer , who , unbeknownst to her , is having an affair with her younger sister , cynthia ( laura san giacomo ) .  complicating matters even worse is graham ( james spader , who won best actor at cannes ) , john's old college buddy , who comes to stay at their house .  ann is absolutely won over by him , even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex .  that is the set-up for the last hour of the picture , and since the film is entitled , " sex , lies , and videotape , " it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise .  director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker , ranging from the independent , to the mainstream ( 1998's " out of sight " ) , to the downright kafkaesque ( 1997's " schizopolis " ) .  he is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances , and believes in the work that he does , and , " sex , lies , and videotape , " is probably his most confident , and maybe even best , to date .  the performances are superb from all four leads , but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character .  she is always a very winning actress , but this is probably her most three-dimensional role that she has had ( with a close second being altman's 1993 mosaic , " short cuts " ) .  the other parts are perfectly cast as well , from spader's ominous graham , to gallagher's self-involved john , to giacomo's outspoken cynthia .  the final act of the film , especially , comes right out of left field , and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching , and it would be criminal to give away the film's secrets .  suffice to say that , through one powerful sequence , ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell , and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty , as well as deception .  the film has one fault , however .  the characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another , and often unlikable .  if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher , it probably would have helped , since his relationship with macdowell isn't quite as explored as i would have liked .   " sex , lies , and videotape , " although minorly flawed , is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film .  soderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it , and the final product certainly proves this .  
0 set in harlem during the great depression , rival gangster " families " go to war over control of " the numbers " , an illegal gambling lottery .   " runners " take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings .  the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen ( cicely tyson ) who is challenged by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) , a ruthless hoodlum .  by turning against the queen , dutch defies his partner , the infamous lucky luciano ( andy garcia ) , who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace .  the queens' army strengthens when an acquaintance , ellsworth " bumpy " johnson ( lawrence fishburne ) is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her .  he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt ( on himself and the queen ) , and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion .  bumpy's reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch .  bloody gang warfare ensues .  bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign .  his new army questions his methods .  his girlfriend ( vanessa l . williams ) and the queen disagree with his violent solutions .  most importantly ( in his eyes ) , dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined , and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him .  there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it .  this movie is not original at all .  in fact , i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and , arguably , the best gangster movie of all time , the godfather .  if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit , why not borrow from a lesser known movie ( say , millers crossing ? ) .  how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ?  here are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 ) .  crooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader .  gang extracts revenge on crooked cop .  wife ( or girlfriend ) questions her partners' murderous activities and leaves him .  high ranking " officer " betrays the leader .  blood relative of the leader murdered .  war erupting between the " families " .  high-ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members .  new leader runs family differently from previous leader .  large meeting with all families involved .  the setup in this movie is done rather well .  i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of " runners " sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery .  this was the way of life in harlem , and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table .  number running was the only way for the harlem population to find work .  i also enjoyed the interaction between the angry , violent dutch and the calm , patient lucky .  after about the 30-40 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing , one after the other ( and in short order ) .  it was a huge distraction , and an insult to my intelligence .  who was the screenwriter kidding here ?  some of the individual performances were well done .  andy garcia was very convincing as lucky , unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role .  tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain , much like his roles in " the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover " and " rob roy " .  the good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the lackluster story that follows .  a couple of coincidences is one thing , over a dozen is an insult .  directed by bill duke  ellsworth bumpy johnson . . . . . . . lawrence  fishburne dutch schultz . . . . . . . . . . . . tim  roth lucky luciano . . . . . . . . . . andy  garcia the queen . . . . . . . . . . . . . cicely tyson francine hughes . . . . . . . . . . vanessa  l . williams illinois gordon . . . . . . . . . . chi  mcbride  written by randy turgeon , january 22 , 1998  
0 synopsis : a man whose lover , paris , was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system .  the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend , laura , and becomes addicted to virtual reality , which , due to a design flaw in his unit , recreates the dead paris .  comments : virtual seduction , executive produced by roger corman and lance h . robbins , serves as a cheaply-made precursor to strange days , a far superior film .  both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ( ab ) using technology to be with former lovers ( in strange days , the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality ) .  interestingly , both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium , though strange days uses the setting far more effectively .  this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction .  it's not bad for what it is : low-budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality .  unfortunately , it's been done before and since in much better films , a fact which ultimately leaves the sci-fi fan bored by this movie .  virtual seduction has many faults ( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins ) .  the film's script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first , but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy-handed and wooden as the movie progresses .  many important scenes seem too dark ; the lighting could have been improved significantly .  the cast , a collection of veteran b-movie actors and sitcom regulars , do only a mediocre job in their roles .  jeff fahey , of the original lawnmower man , convincingly , though unenergetically , plays the lead character .  carrie genzel plays paris , the vr lover , but ami dolenz , as the current love interest , seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality , which doesn't lend credence to the film's premise .  meschach taylor , of the once popular designing women sitcom , adequately plays a scientist working on the project , but his performance isn't something to write home about either .  virtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background .  in other words , one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then , but it's rather boring to just sit and watch .  the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from b-movies in this genre , but it is still an adult r-rated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt .  this turkey , ultimately , isn't awful , but it's not particularly interesting or unique either .  don't be seduced into watching this movie unless you've got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch .  
0 this review contains spoilers , but believe me , i don't say anything you can't guess 10 minutes into the movie .  i * did * go into this one with high expectations .  i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks .  i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining .  i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film .  boy , was i wrong !  another garbage slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story !  the story , you ask ?  well , a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk .  he takes it home , somehow getting it past customs : - ) and starts fiddling with it in his attic .  lo and behold , after he takes it apart , three demons appear and start taking him apart , but with meat hooks .  when they're finished , his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling .  they botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn't really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard .  the guy's brother and his brother's wife appear at the door soon after , and decide to move in .  they throw away scumball's belongings , and set up house .  turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho , and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage .  she starts having some wild hallucinations .  later , hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards ( slow-mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground--all from the tiny cut on his hand ) .  said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball's organ .  the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing .  it establishes mind contact with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be screwed again .  so , she helps him kill three businessmen .  scumball , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back .  problem is , he doesn't have any skin , and even after three or four corpses , still doesn't get any skin .  he finally gets some , though , but strangely enough , he ends up looking like his brother .  guess they couldn't get the original actor back .  who knows .  scumball ( whose name is frank ) is not a nice guy .  he describes his torture by the demons fondly , as the " ultimate pleasure and pain , since at that level there is no difference between the two . "  somehow , i don't see getting torn apart by 90 fish- and meat-hooks a lot of fun .  this guy is * so * bad ( " how bad * is * he ? " ) ,   * so * bad that the * rats * cower in a corner in fear .  for good reason , too ; he crucifies two of them for fun , and carves a third while the nympho's horsing around with hubby .  anyway . hubby's daughter ( who , if course , is not * wife's * daughter ) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams .  the dumb bimbo meets scumball , and is not impressed .  she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle , and brings out the demons .  at any rate , the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup ; they're normally quite meticulous about that type of thing .  the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake .  the demons are not , however , the good guys .  the dumb bimbo's the good guy .  she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank , but also banishes them to hell or oblivion , we're not too sure which .  not too shabby for someone with single-digit iq .  this is basically a " bad jinn " story .  it is an * awful * movie .  awful acting , bad focus in the photography , many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks , which is really unrealistic , and looks like the latex that it is .  continuity ?  who cares .  acting ?   * terrible * .  script ?  horrible .  sounds canned .  unrealistic .  story is so-so , but the impact is lost long , long before the film ends .  i do think the * rat * acting was quite good .  i have never seen rats look afraid .  they should get nominated for an award .  really good acting there , the best in the movie .   " the envelope for best furry rodent , please . . . "  a " " rating would be far too generous .  a " 1/10 " rating ( or -4 in the -4 to +4 rating system ) is far more accurate .  this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing , chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog .  i can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show .  people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen .  had to have something to do .  dumb , dumb , dumb movie .  i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it .  it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself .  lots of slime and red-dyed corn syrup does not constitute " horror , " in my opinion .  
0  " idle hands " is distasteful , crass and derivative .  if an original thought found its way into this horror-comedy it would die of loneliness .  plus , you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen-agers the week after the tragedy in littleton , colo .  the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teen-agers .  the plot , what little there is , deals with anton ( devon sawa ) , a high-school slacker who's hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed .  along the way the hand kills anton's parents and his two best friends .  the friends , also slackers , are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them .  that is the level of this's atrocity's humor .  the movie treats death as a joke .   " idle hands " is gruesome and morbid .  the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish .  i realize this is supposed to pass for comedy , but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen .  it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life .  and i can only presume that the writers of " idle hands , " terri hughes and ron milbauer , were trying to make some statement about today's young people and their values in a satiric vein .  however , it's hard to laugh at death these days , especially ones involving young people .  with the real horrors of the world put before us on television , a stale pastry such as " idle hands " should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths .   " idle hands " is bad , no matter the circumstances in the world outside .  but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings .  the time is not right for this type of movie .  and as far as " idle hands " goes , the time may never be right .  this is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema .  
0 the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don't count neil simon's biloxi blues ) .  year after year , more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt .  bilko -- and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last .  i thought stripes would be different .  with ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter , it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army .  instead , it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army .  murray , about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs , plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success , and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him .  so he does , and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell , head-shaving and marching/singing sequences , more mind-numbingly stale here than ever .  the characters are even less original , ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette .  all the big name stars in stripes ( and even larroquette ) fall victim to the lame , rehashed material and are never really likeable , murray in particular .  he only gets a few decent lines in , although those barely-funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters .  he was even better in caddyshack , for crying out loud .  as with a lot of the late 70's / early 80's comedies , stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex- obsessed no child should be able to watch it .  i'm sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women , but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition " dear god ! "  every few seconds .  stripes isn't the playful kind of sex comedy , either .  most of the time it seems downright misogynistic , as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women's showers or murray lifts a female m . p .  onto the stove and , with an i-know-what-you-like look on his face , says he's going to give her the " aunt jemima treatment , " which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly .  you don't want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region .   " i'm not enjoying this , " the woman protests .  my sentiments exactly .  
1 i've noticed something lately that i've never thought of before .  pseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films .  have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ?  more and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff .  i'm not trying to say city of angels is that bad .  it had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered .  somehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography .  the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment .  but for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time .  nicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life .  meg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive .  after losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient's transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor .  he begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday .  angels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire .  seth's adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community .  the angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness .  cage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once .  it's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire .  the two aren't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual " intelligently ditzy " romantic comedy roles , and it's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy .  but even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye .  it's a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn't know quite how to get to it .  they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high .  filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths .  based on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending .  most movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized .  nonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories .  
1 every once in a while , when an exceptional family film comes along , i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non-disney films disappear in a couple of weeks .  now i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films .  so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film-making : see matilda .  see it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video .  see the best film i have seen in 1996 .  not the best children's film . . . the  best film .  period .  based on a story by roald dahl , it tells of young matilda wormwood ( mara wilson ) , an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents : harry ( danny devito ) , a crooked used car salesman ; and zinnia ( rhea perlman ) , a simple-minded bingo addict .  the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books .  when they finally do send her to school , it is to crunchem hall , a bleak place run by cruel , child-hating miss agatha trunchbull ( pam ferris ) .  but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher , miss honey ( embeth davidtz ) , who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness .  matilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull's cruelty .  it was this spring's james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda .  and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito .  devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images .  in one scene , an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig-tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer ; later , an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert .  matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale .  it is also characteristic of the best children's tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don't realize that they are learning them .  there is a hilarious moment when matilda's television-addicted father snatches away the book she is reading ( in a wicked joke , he thinks _moby dick_ is pornographic ) and forces her to watch an inane game show ( hosted by jon lovitz ) in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around .  matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because " i'm big and you're little , i'm right and you're wrong . "  more specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people's notions of how she should behave .  it is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women .  finally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word .  devito knows enough to make matilda fast-paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house .  the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character .  but there are also many , many delights for adults , including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda's classmates recite in sing-song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda's father .  i can't imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted .  matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling .  i will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my children .  and now i will stop , because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child .  
0 what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project .  most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films .  john frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60's , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin .  screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd .  ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes .  even charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn't act , did a decent job in cider house rules .  when all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining .  after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration .  the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining .  the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are .  it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights .  we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar .  the actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun .  reindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don't seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn't look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest .  evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled " boy this movie is horrible ! "  and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments .  the story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) .  nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person .  when nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays .  unfortunately ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship .  thinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard .  now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel .  confused ?  the movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax .  but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour .  the hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley .  some hero .  the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire .  when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times .  the most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason .  the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead .  the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food .  why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me .  why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me .  
0 susan granger's review of " jeepers creepers " ( mgm/ua entertainment )  this nasty , little horror film begins as a bickering brother ( justin long ) and sister ( gina philips ) are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped-up bodies down a drainage pipe .  when long decides to investigate , there's nothing but trouble .   " you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it ?  - well , this is it ! "  philips warns .  what he finds in the basement of an old , abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying , jagged-stitched incision from his neck to his navel , plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies , stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry .  long flees but now the monstrous , winged creeper ( jonathan breck ) is after both of them !  eileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle , a psychic who explains the evil creature's bizarre feeding habits .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " jeepers creepers " is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion , giving new meaning to the old song " jeepers creepers . "  and now - as paul harvey would say - for the rest of the story .  what's more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writer/director victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 year-old actor in california .  sentenced to three years in prison , he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992 .  when salva made " powder " ( 1995 ) , the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities , disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as a pedophile .  and now , once again , in this mgm/ua film , that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio .  
0 if you're into watching near on two hours of bored , foul-mouthed florida teens having sex , doing drugs , having sex , listening to eminem , having sex , playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers , then " bully " 's for you .  based on jim schutze's novelization of a true-life event , " bully " charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood .  the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers .  in the hands of controversial director larry clark ( " kids " ) , however , it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker's pornographic proclivities .  in terms of the incident and what provoked it , " bully " stirs up nothing new .  the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane .  the bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn't exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department .  he hounds and harries and humiliates his " best friend " marty ( played by brad renfro ) and marty's girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) doesn't care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby .  simply remove him from the equation .  marty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off .  there's no remorse--the next day they're talking about it as openly as a homework assignment .  they did it because they wanted to , and because they could .  what's most troubling about the film , however , isn't the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material .  not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in " bully " but there's also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it .  gratuitous crotch shots abound ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in " there's something about mary " look like the height of subtlety ! ) .  clark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about .  the stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors ( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time , as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera .  the conclusion of " bully " offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime .  it's a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--but it's infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it .   " bully " aims for truth , exploits it shamelessly , then bludgeons it to death .  
0 synopsis : lifelong friends rafe ( affleck ) and danny ( hartnett ) join the us air force and are stationed at pearl harbor , hawaii .  rafe goes to england to fight alongside british pilots and is seemingly killed in action .  danny falls in love with rafe's girlfriend , evelyn ( beckinsale ) , but rafe survives and returns to confront his former friend .  meanwhile , the japanese sneak attack is imminent . . .  review : " pearl harbor " is a perfect example of movies as product rather than as art .  it is little more than a crassly-calculated attempt to woo the masses , enticing them with big stars , big effects , and a big setting -- but no heart .  it is difficult to criticise the actors , because they do everything the movie demands of them .  sadly , this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing " pearl harbor " with his left .  the plot here is pure cliche , and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop .  there is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states , and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii .  instead , there is just an assembly-line love triangle , some empty patriotic rhetoric , and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders ( when one intones , " i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant " , i nearly fell out of my seat ) .  to the movie's credit , it does include a fantastic portrayal of the attack itself , an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into the war .  if only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such skill , perhaps this memorial day non-event would have been worth watching .  
0  " the red violin " is a cold , sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached .  it's a movie that seems almost clinical , as it traces the 300-plus-years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title .  opening in the 17th century , the story shows how violin-maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son .  but when tragedy strikes , the violin becomes the personification of its maker's grief .  from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery .  again , tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph .  we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in mao's communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz ( samuel l . jackson ) , who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity .  the violin becomes morritz's obsession , just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it .  morritz , however , is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creator's intention .   " the red violin " could have been a touching , inspirational story , as soaring as a beethoven symphony .  however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer .  here is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact .  girard , for some unknown reason , uses mostly master shots , keeping his camera - and thus us - at a distance .  we get no feel for the miracle that is the violin .  it's resonance , its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression .  nor are any of the performances memorable .  it's as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin .   " the red violin " promises much , but delivers little .  it is dull at times , a bit pretentious and a might murky .  the movie's music soars over its story and performers .  and that is its only saving grace .  
1 >from the commercials , this looks like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight .  instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end .  the concept is deceptively pedestrian .  an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way .  the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea .  the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents .  following one dead end lead after another , each funnier than the previous , they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin .  it's difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot .  seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one .  without giving too much away , one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion .  and it's all done in a fairly clean , almost ( well , maybe not exactly ) family fare manner .  a grand cast ( tomlin , alda , moore , ben stiller , patricia arquette , tea leoni , george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs .  drawing from a more hyper woody allen style , the film succeeds beyond expectations .  
1 in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance .  ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's .  in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world .  you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open .  in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful .  he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes .  grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map .  when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms .  grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy .  their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for .  leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions .  he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges .  he's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated .  he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) .  whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white .  leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth .  tobey maguire fits well in the role .  with his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude .  but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility .  katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants .  this is a plot line i had trouble with .  douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions .  at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones .  seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping .  suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas .  there is a movie in there somewhere .  grady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor .  okay , maybe not so chivalrous .  there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , " she was a junkie for the printed word .  lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice " .  robert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm .  downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual .  he's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance .  the actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor .  i wish wonder boys had more of him .  searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that's part of its charm .  and maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i'm greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema .  everyone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to .  i'm privy to films about literary types i . e .  those individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch .  the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points .  sometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that's a problem i wish i found with films more often .  another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up .  for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags .  the gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do .  the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn't ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things .  curtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films .  he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up .  the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits .  the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen .  it's the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies .  many will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties .  
0 kate ( jennifer aniston ) is having some problems .  it appears the twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder , and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired .  she learns that her problems are related , as the owner of her advertising agency , mr . mercer ( kevin dunn ) , explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company .  her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company , taking clients with her .  a solution presents itself in nick ( jay mohr ) , a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with .  kate's boss , darcy ( illeana douglas ) , uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick .  kate is at first repulsed by the idea , but after getting immediate positive results , she pursues it .  her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan .  the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc ? .  at a dinner with kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up .  she meets nick to propose the plan .  he accepts .  kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas .  the office bad boy , sam ( kevin bacon ) , who wouldn't give kate the time of day , now does .  now that she is engaged , he pursues an affair with her , as doing so would destroy her good girl image , hence sam's sudden interest .  things start to fall apart for kate , as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her , and does not wish to break up with her .  after some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate .  it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available .  or maybe kate does like nick , but " reconciliation " will force her to admit her lies to her employer .  adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , who wants her to get married and settle down .  there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra .  it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one .  there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer .  it's like the director said 'well , we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren't that great so , what the heck , let's show jennifer's assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating . "  quite frankly it's insulting .  i don't think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie .  she did a decent enough job in ed burns' " she's the one " because it was a smaller and supporting role , and she just doesn't deliver the goods effectively in this movie .  her performance was not convincing .  unfortunately , as far as romantic comedies go , this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies .  the film is similar to " my best friends wedding " in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions , gets no sympathy from me when things go awry .  i didn't care for how quickly kate puts down nick's profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn't glamorous enough for her co-workers .  at least " my best friends wedding " changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending .  no such luck with " picture perfect " .  every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away , including a couple that really made no sense .  after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company , why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first , let alone consider a relationship ?  was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick ?  throw in the fact that i don't think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision .  i believe that kate liked him , but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away ?  i doubt it .  and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple ?  are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers ?  well , i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars , then that would make sense .  picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron  kate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . jennifer aniston nick . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . jay  mohr sam . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . kevin  bacon mercer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . kevin  dunn darcy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . illeana  douglas rita . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . olympia  dukakis  written by randy turgeon , february 26 , 1998 .  visit my movie reviews !  www . xtdl . com/~canran  
0 movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable .  i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics .  we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too .  this picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) .  the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno .  so , it does indeed have some plusses . . .  in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff .  and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone .  this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? )  far too annoying far too often .  like in 1998s " bulworth " , when the movie was over i didn't care one little iota about the main character .  at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though .   " showgirls " is too stupid to make a statement .  some people claim that the story is based on the legendary " all about eve " of all things !  if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l . mankiewicz was , he'd be . . . well ,  he'd be a good screenwriter .  instead , this project may have sunk his career .  he wrote the ( ha ha ! )  script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed .  the same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( " basic instinct " ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones .  the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer .  after the supposed street-smart young " lady " gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the " stardust hotel " .  nomi doesn't take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away .  first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club .  she sells her hot little wares at " the cheetah " for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience .  hey , i never said she wasn't a hot number . . .  maybe it's that , her body , which gets her into the big-time when the star of the " stardust hotel " , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn't her brains or pleasant disposition ! ) .  crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) .  he also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show .  crystal gets nomi onto the " stardust " team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi " earns " the role of crystal's understudy .  the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal .  it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she's " not a whore " .  that's a phrase we hear a few different times and it's completely ludicrous .  of course she is !  she sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we're supposed to believe that she's a better person than that .  we're supposed to root for her .  no way !  she's a tramp and a back-stabber who deserved nothing--least of all vindication in the . . . ahem . . . climax .  she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is .  the sub-plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more .  it sure ain't character development !  plummer also appeared in " speed " in '94 in a smaller , yet better role .  this sub-plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control .  kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or his standards have dipped since appearing in " blue velvet " .  that picture was weird , but some critics claim it's one of the best movies of the '80s .  now ol' kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the '90s , too .  his sleazy character is important to " showgirls " , but we don't learn anything about him .  he uses people to get what he wants , but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie .  is he a villain ?  who cares !  ultimately , this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit .  everyone must know by now about the soft-core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool .  what few reviewers take issue with is how mean-spirited this movie is .  everyone's either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge .  it's just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) .  if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn't verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ?  it's hard to care about these people if we can't even appreciate what they're capable of doing on-stage .  berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body .  after all , the world of porn is still an active , dishonourable profession .  perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford .  oops , they're bad actors , too .  well , at least , they're not selfish and contemptable like good ol' slutty nomi malone .  useless trivia--ironically , elizabeth berkley played virtuous and " holier than thou " jessie on the teeny-bopper tv show , " saved by the bell " , before breaking onto the big screen .  
1 warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film " fail-safe . "  if you haven't seen the film yet , proceed with caution .  nutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama .  still powerful today , even after the end of the cold war .  -------------------- " fail-safe " ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes  screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet  review by jamahl epsicokhan --------------------  the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side .  in a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives .  the idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs .  this is the theme of sidney lumet's " fail-safe , " a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler .   " fail-safe " takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism .  the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws .  five u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america .  the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers .  suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike .  a great deal of " fail-safe " 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost .  the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios .  the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails .  general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable .  the events in " fail-safe " are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason " fail-safe " works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot .  a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it .  most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war .  many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices .  early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of " strategy " in a nuclear assault to " minimize " casualties .   " what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? "  a guest asks impatiently .   " forty million , " groeteschele responds wryly .  the problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war .  the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals .  groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over .  yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended .  on the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage .  such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race .   " fail-safe " clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film .  why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ?  is it wise ?  is it even logical ?  no , not really .  although " fail-safe " is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way .  again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance .  in addition to providing the central " pro-nuclear war " voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism .  the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib .  one of groeteschele's " logical " trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd .  he labels the average marxist an " unfeeling , calculating machine " that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself .  groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia's home soil--which must be preserved at all costs .  groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would .  the irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing .  he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns .  once the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be .  just how will the soviet union's leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ?   ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? )  with the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet's long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader .  without getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances .   ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear " incident " can probably be . )  it does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn't possible because of its all-too-real consequences .  dramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o'herlihy's character as the symbolic " matador " ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film's opening ) , is particularly appropriate .   " fail-safe " is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film .  nevertheless , under lumet's direction and walter bernstein's intelligent adaptation of burdick's and wheeler's novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded .  the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming .  but it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that " fail-safe " also finds dangerous .  in retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century .  it's just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele's dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown .  
0 plot : two sister witches have to live with a curse placed upon their family , which prevents them from ever enjoying a full life with a lover .  the hex invokes the eventual demise of their loved one .  when one of their past loves comes back to haunt them , they have to figure a way out of their eternal dilemma .  critique : i've been waiting for a good witch movie for a while now , but hold on to your brooms and incantations , cause this puppy is far from being it !  for a film that has the word " magic " in its title , this movie contains very few moments of magic . . . or  humor for that matter , drama , suspense , or romance .  well actually , there is some manufactured romance within a plot that is so muddled , it never lets you in on whether it's a comedy , a drama , a horror show , or a murder mystery .  or maybe it's a romance , eh ?  it doesn't really matter , cause the characters in the film are so boring and uninteresting , that you have absolutely no basis on which to care for them , or the film as a whole .  if only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious soundtrack , this film might've had a chance to be more than what it is now .  which is an unentertaining , crappy film that uses the witch angle as a diversionary tactic to weave us away from its grab-bag of stupid voice-overs , overdone songs , melodramatic romance , undeveloped story and uneven acting .  i only wish that i could make that one hour and forty-five minutes of my life re-appear , but alas , it is lost in the spiritual world of " interesting ideas gone wildly awry " .  little known facts about this film and its stars : this film is based on the novel written by alice hoffman .  co-screenwriter akiva goldsman also wrote the screenplay for 1997's batman & robin .  director griffin dunne is known mainly as an actor in such films as an american werewolf in london and after hours .  
0 drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside - the one who's the awkward klutz or the spunky do-it-yourselfer ; the one who just doesn't fit in with the others .  she has perfected these characters in movies such as " the wedding singer " and , most notably , " ever after . "  now she's back , starring in what could be called a modern-day cinderella fable - " never been kissed . "  you know it's a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary .  trust me on this one , no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg ( and i don't mean steve ) invented the printing press .  the premise is simple .  barrymore's josie geller , at 25 the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago sun-times , is assigned to go undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what today's teens are feeling and doing .  josie ( she says she was named after the '70s cartoon character ) was a geek in high school , so she jumps at the opportunity for a second chance .  this time , she thinks , she will get it right and be accepted by the in-crowd .  now , what kind of adult - with a good job and a successful career - would actually look forward to reliving the hell that was - and is - high school and adolescence .  these are among the many problems that plague " never been kissed . "  screenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get a handle of josie .  their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy , blubbering woman-child at the least provocation .  and the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high school's most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability .  ok , so " never been kissed " is not a sociological expose of today's high school scene .  however , certain rules should apply to film , and one of those is consistency of character .  among the movie's problems is the ill-conceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and , in the process , lose focus on her assignment .  any competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say " get me rewrite . "  to be fair , barrymore is very appealing , but she is given very little to work with .  she tries valiantly to get a firm grip on her character , but the script continually undermines her .  barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she tries to walk , talk and act like a cool , hip high schooler .  otherwise , she is left foundering on a cliched sea of teen-age stereotypes and situations .   " never been kissed " is entertaining and funny in fits and starts .  it lacks consistency and a firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish .  the movie's main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys , the outsider who befriends new student josie .  josie sees a lot of her former self in aldys , yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls .  real mature .  and that is the main deficiency with " never been kissed . "  it's illogical , unrealistic , uneven and undemanding .  it has some warm and humorous spots , but not enough to overcome its many obstacles .  
1 one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel .  that concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century .  however , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h . g . wells' novel the time machine , wasn't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences .  the author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour .  whatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages .  instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space .  the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration .  first of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own .  the plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time .  at the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time .  they are skeptical , but that doesn't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future .  at first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars .  finally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions .  when he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines .  but , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld .  the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times .  for h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie .  even the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era .  compared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films .  of course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness .  for example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today .  some of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing .  but , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture .  the acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george's trusted friend filby .  yvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role .  however , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science-fiction films sorely miss these days .

"  --- dr . alexander mccabe ( bob gunton ) , in response to why he created evil bats .  alright folks , stop me if you've heard this one : genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals , assisted by a specialist in the particular animal's field , must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth .  oh yeah , the military is on their way to bomb the town as well , so they are running short on time .  sound familiar ?  such is the plot of the destination films release of bats .  dina meyer stars as the " bat specialist " sheila , who is pulled from her research ( along with her annoying sidekick , played with irritating deftness by leon ) in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently .  with the help of the local sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) , a cdc official ( carlos jacott ) , and a scientist ( bob gunton ) , sheila discovers it is indeed bats ( who have been genetically altered by gunton's character to be more aggressive and omnivorous , in order to be used as a military weapon ! ) .  i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film .  there's not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good .  in this respect , the film never disappointed me .  this film reaches a level that transcends the " so bad it's good " level and borders on the downright insane .  the effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think ) .  i challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face .  thankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with .  dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers . . .  the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception .  while one never really gets the impression that meyer's character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either .  she gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she's nice to look at for an hour and a half .  lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero .  although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what's going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats .  the only bad performance in the film is that of leon's .  he is relegated to the " i'm not sticking around here ! "  character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays .  anyone who can't immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it .  even if he hadn't been the villain in just about every film he's ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever .  in fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale .  if the plot doesn't sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol .  an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor's orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk .  a government official blows off shelia's instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit .  a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it .  finally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it's single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we're lucky to even get kevin smith's dogma ) .  the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill-conceived bat puppets .  while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what's going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key .  therefore we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film .  being able to see the puppeteer's arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse .  after all of this , if you still decide bats might be the movie for you , don't say you haven't been warned .  trust me when i say that it's a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through .  i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in .  she's definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these .  
1 today , war became a reality to me after seeing a screening of saving priivate ryan .  steve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production .  the audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing the horror of war .  please keep the kids home as the r rating is for reality .  tom hanks is stunning as capt john miller , set out in france during ww ii to rescue and return home a soldier , private ryan ( matt damon ) who lost three brothers in the war .  spielberg at time takes us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes .  private ryan is not for everyone , but i felt the time was right for a movie like this to be made .  the movie reminds us of the sacrifices made by our ww ii fighting men and women .  we must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice , their lives so that we may live in freedom today .  for this i thank them and for steve spielberg for making a movie that i will never forget .  the academy will not forget tom hanks come april 1999 , as another well deserved oscar with be in tom's posession .  
1 i swear i have seen the edge before .  in fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film .  however , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot .  in doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker .  unfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film .  but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head .  one surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script .  action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence .  even horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all .  the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s .  the intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day .  the edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall .  i must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes .  this is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) .  if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) .  the edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film .  but taking scream's lead , the edge makes fun of the genre's cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) .  charles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him .  for once , we don't immediately care for the main character .  instead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness .  they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic .  charles' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob .  as action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect .  soon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his " personality . "  charles , bob , bob's assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter .  down the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness .  director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations .  he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film .  take , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot .  this has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears .  but given the charles' intelligence , and bob's uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists .  even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before .  my favorite line of the film comes from charles : " most people die in the wilderness because they didn't do the one thing that could save their life . . .  thinking . "  despite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn't as it seems anymore .  i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely .  the first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice .  tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility .  i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water .  why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ?  i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while .  thankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide .  but some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) .  the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal .  anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day .  hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs .  alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) .  baldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way .  you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer .  elle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight .  she isn't in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model .  harold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed .  he is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable .  the edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language .  some of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me .  this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down .  director tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts .  david mamet's script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid .  the best thing about the script is the ending which doesn't end with the normal high-strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift .  it's a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear .  and by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear .  way to go , bart .  
1  " a private matter " is based on the true story of sherri finkbine and the events in her life during the 1960s .  after becoming pregnant ( for the fifth time ) she learns that some tranquilizers she had taken have seriously deformed her unborn child .  she and her husband decide , with the help of her doctor , to have an abortion .  but this is the 1960s , and abortion is illegal .  her doctor has made arrangements to have the procedure performed withing the law , by claiming that the child is endangering the mother's life .  everything is about to work out just fine , until sherri has the uncontrollable urge to talk about her situation with a local reporter .  this sets off a media frenzy and immediately sherri is the most hated woman in the world .  she and her husband are fired from their jobs , reporters are surrounding their home at all times , and most importantly , no one in the country ( and eventually other countries ) will perform the abortion .  this causes emotion problems for all involved .   " a private matter " is a fascinating story and it's hard to believe that this only happened 30 years or so ago .  it's only flaw is that not once is there ever a satisfactory confrontation with sherri and any of her opponents .  one woman passing her on the street telss her to burn in hell , and when sherri appropriately yells back , " just tell me what i'm supposed to do , " the woman has no answer .  no one apparently had an answer , they just wanted to control what should have been only the choice of sherri and her husband .  this is an important film , telling an important story .  it's not just about not wanting another child , it's about not wanting a child who will cause severe changes in their family , none of which could be beneficial .  sydney pollack served as executive producer for this made for hbo movie .  
1 i know it already opened in december , but i finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend , and it was one of those rare oppritunites that i got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price .  as the final scene closed out in happy slow-mo fashion , i felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking .  jason schwartzman , his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses , steals the show as max fischer , the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades , but compensates for it by organizing most of the school's clubs and organizations ( i . e .  the fencing team and writing and producing school plays ) and often pulling outrageous stunts , one that eventually earns him an expulsion .  this stunt , building an aquarium on the school's baseball diamond , is a plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) .  he funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume ( a very oscarworthy bill murray ) , who eventually finds himself falling in love with miss cross .  rosemary and herman begin dating-and the fun begins ; herman and max go at it head to head in a battle for miss cross .  herman manages to destroy max's bike , while max cuts herman's brakes , and it goes on like this .  but eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross , and he can't stand in the way of two people in love .  the academy of arts & sciences really messed up this year ; they completely overlooked rushmore ( and , if you ask me , it wasn't an accident ) .  it maybe wasn't best picture material , but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod ( instead of elizabeth ) , and bill murray's absense from the ballot is a complete snub .  the entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good ; at one point it's fun , and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic .  the cinematography gives the movie an important feeling , as well .  i hope rushmore can overcome its' oscar snubs , and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers .  
1 synopsis : an attractive mute makeup artist , working on an ultra-cheesy slasher movie in moscow , witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians .  meanwhile , the artist's sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her .  comments : mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it .  drawn by the clever artwork on the video box , i rented the film expecting a complete turkey .  mute witness , however , was original , offbeat , and well-made .  it's one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about .  i've subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit , and it may be seen , on occasion , on the independent film channel .  the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense , as billy , the quite believable mute heroine , sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film .  the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy's vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures .  to throw a curveball into the fray , billy's sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes .  a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film .  look for alec guinness ( obi-wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy ) in a small role as the evil reaper .  definately check this movie out ; although , as a word of warning , it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly aren't for the squeamish .  
0 note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .   " quick , robin !  the anti-shark repellant ! "  - adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg  i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard .  this is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it's loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill .  batman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss .  by ivy's side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast .  the villains' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy's intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life .  meanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone ) .  akiva goldsman's screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement .  it makes goldsman's screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison .  i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i'd seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan's island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production .  joel schumacher's direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance .  there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly-pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy's chosen new abode .  another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late-night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons .  mr . schumacher's focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective .  it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film's opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered .  is batman and robin supposed to be campy ?  i think it is - it's hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously .   ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted " bomb ! "  each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory . )  is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ?  i somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn't attempting to be the utter farce which it is .  arnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr . freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be .  mr . schwarzenegger's attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable .  by the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen .  the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of " cool ! "  in the least inventive way .  george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film .  his batman is hardly an imposing figure .  chris o'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all .  the film's one saving grace ?  undoubtably uma thurman's entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy .  her work in batman and robin is certainly over-the-top , but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film .  ms . thurman's comic timing is impeccable , and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully .   ( i'm already starting to positively reassess jim carrey's performance in batman forever . )  her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film , and when she's offscreen the film greatly suffers .  i figure that if one has to die , being kissed to death by uma thurman isn't a half-bad way to go .  while batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse-pounding excitement , i must admit that i was not bored watching it , although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening - my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one-liner , and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat .  it's been a long time since i've laughed so much at a movie .   " at " , of course , is the operative word .  
1 david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director .  with his distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible .  some of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline .  and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right .  oh , and it's rated g .  incidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else's work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century .  he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow , a rich , aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note .   " did you do it ? " he asks his boy .   " no father , i didn't , " ronnie answers .  that's enough for arthur , who , with his oldest daughter ( rebecca pidgeon ) , immediately starts a crusade to bring his son's case to court .  they enlist the help of sir robert morton , a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task .  it all seems fairly frivolous , and no matter how you look at it , the winslow case is not the trial of the century .  but arthur is determined to keep his family's word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that .  soon enough , sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings .  so do we .  all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue , but his style is still fairly apparent .  the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense .  but this is not mamet's norm , and it's refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks , gangsters as con men , wonderful as those films were .  nigel hawthorne's performance is nearly flawless .  his delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game .  we pity the man , but we also like him .  rebecca pidgeon , david mamet's wife , who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur's oldest daughter , a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the women's suffrage movement .  the winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher -- it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one .  be honest : did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill ?  if you wanted to but didn't , this is a movie for you .  it is the epitome of subtlety : it's powerful without being too emotional , sad without even trying to be depressing .  david mamet can churn out some great scripts , but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too .  he is almost a national treasure .  his films deserve their own genre .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  
1 for a movie about disco-era excess , " 54 " comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club .  think of it as a sort of " boogie nights " -lite - where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift , " 54 " leaves the kinkier details to your imagination .  it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter , but it thankfully never resorts to preaching , either .  in fact , were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment , " 54 " would be about as feathery as the time period's popular female hairstyle .  studio 54 was a haven for the rich , famous and generally good-looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986 .  inside , anything went and , we are told , everything did .  the film's fictional main character is shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , the jerky jock from " i know what you did last summer " ) , a fresh-faced 19-year-old who dreams of venturing beyond the club's velvet rope and coming face-to-face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines .  his wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell ( mike myers ) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in '79 and permits him passage - but not before he doffs his hideous shirt , of course .  once inside , shane becomes seduced by the club's dizzying vortex of sex and drugs .  he has such a good time that he doesn't want to leave , so he seeks employment as a busboy .  he quickly becomes friends with greg ( breckin meyer ) and anita ( salma hayek ) , a married couple who work along side of him ; greg's a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender , while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own .  after rubbing elbows ( among other things ) with a renowned socialite ( sela ward ) and gaining the personal interest of rubell , shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54 .  but fame doesn't come without a price .   " 54 " 's major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players - at a slim hour-and-a-half , the film is too short to take on such a multi-character focus , and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act .  alleged last-minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction , since " 54 " sometimes feels like it's missing a scene here or there .  nowhere is this more apparent than in shane's relationship with soap opera actress julie black ( neve campbell ) , a frequent studio 54 patron whom he's long admired from afar .  the romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special .  that " 54 " works despite these limitations , then , is largely due to the competence and energy with which it's assembled .  sure , it's shallow , slick , sanitized portrait of a bygone age , and sure , we've seen the rags-to-riches story gazillions of times , but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision .  the film boasts some fine comic creativity , the pinnacle of which is disco dottie ( " the wedding singer " 's ellen dow ) , an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public , but slides up to shane behind 54's closed doors and asks for a " funky little treat . "  the solid , sexy cast smooths out - if only while you're caught up in the film - any rough spots belonging to their alter-egos or the plot .  newcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat ; he and campbell , as fetching as ever , look so good together it's a shame their subplot goes nowhere .  meyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in " clueless " ( he was the stoner with the joker-smile ) , while hayek simply sizzles , especially when leading a dance class with the mantra , " one , two , three , attitude ! "  sherry stringfield , unidentifiable under big '70s hair , takes on her first big-screen gig since she left " er " as rubell's accountant , but she's criminally underused .  as the droopy-eyed , drug-addled steve rubell , myers is worth the price of admission alone .  when he's not playing the life of the party , the ex- " saturday night live " comedian strips away all of rubell's confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty , unhappy life with exorbitance ; it's a moment worthy of pity when , while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening , he attempts to seduce one of his employees .  and while his performance is largely serious , myers mixes the empathy with a delicate " austin powers " -esque wink , thus keeping consistent with " 54 " 's overall feel - gaudy , larger-than-life and satisfyingly ornamental , not unlike a giant disco ball .  
0 have you ever been in an automobile accident where you've miraculously walked away with only a few scratches , yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable , mangled wreck ?  well , that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation .  but after watching this inane exercise of a movie , i certainly feel that i've miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond .  oddly , `eye of the beholder , ' which is a psychological-romance-thriller , starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent , called the eye ( ewan mcgregor ) , working in washington dc .  in the humorous opening scene , he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down .  using an array of high-tech surveillance and communications equipment , he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office .  the law firm's employees get a good chuckle .  the audience gets a good chuckle .  the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) .  there is something compelling about this mysterious woman .  despite her glamorous looks , however , we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her .  after the murders , she sobs while singing the christmas tune `little bluebirds' and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago .  after each killing , she puts on a different wig , assumes a new name , and then makes her way to another state .  the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions .  but he does not alert the authorities .  he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss .  the eye , it turns out , also is haunted by his past .  his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life .  his tormented psyche creates a ghost-like image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation .  she becomes a sort of spectral adviser , and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman .  he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation .  it doesn't matter that he has witnessed all of her murders .  and it doesn't matter that the eye is abnormally reticent , hiding his entire life behind computer screens .  he follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble .  when a crazed druggie ( jason priestley ) attacks her , he shows up for some quick butt kicking .  when the police are closing in to arrest her , he provides a distraction so that she can escape .  all the while , the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight .  peculiar .  how bad is this movie ?  i refer you to my `review quote source' litmus test .  just take a look at the full-page ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes .  for this movie , they are from magazines called `flaunt' and `mirabella . '  no doubt , they were impressed with judd's series of catwalks and disguise changes .  the major problem with `eye of the beholder' is that the film jerks forward , always unsure of its ultimate destination .  if it was a thriller , there was little to keep us entranced .  if it was a love story , there was absolutely no emotional pull .  completely disjointed in structure , it's only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial ( the one where the `6' on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a child's train set ) .  i am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents .  beyond that , the film is hopelessly out-of-control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling .  
1 hedwig and the angry inch ( 2001 ) john cameron mitchell , miriam shor , stephen trask , michael pitt , theodore liscinski , michael aronov , andrea martin , maurice dean wint , ben mayer-goodman .  animation by emily hubley .  adapted from the stage play by john cameron mitchell and stephen trask .  music and lyrics by stephn trask .  written and directed by john cameron mitchell .  91 minutes .  rated r , stars )  had " hedwig and the angry inch " came out in the '70s , right after david bowie's " ziggy stardust , " it likely would now be regarded as one of the most popular rock musicals of all time .  released in the 500 channel , sensory overload world of 2001 , however , the big screen adaptation of the acclaimed off-broadway musical must do battle with countless other productions clamoring for attention .  i almost missed it .  every august , the major studios try to squeeze the last few dollars out of summer moviegoers by dumping all of their shakier offerings on the marketplace at once .  i was so busy trying to keep up with national releases like " summer catch " and " bubble boy " that i passed over any independent film that looked like it would only have a short local run .  but an e-mail from a reader asking why i hadn't reviewed the movie prompted me to make a late evening trip to the theater .  thank goodness for readers like him .   " hedwig and the angry inch " is a gender-bending glam-rock spectacular packed with great songs .  stylistically , the hook-laden tunes are reminiscent of bowie , " bat out of hell " era meatloaf and " the rocky horror show , " without ever seeming like imitations .  as with " tommy , " " hedwig " tells a story of isolation , pain and defiance , but without the bloated feel of that beloved , but overrated rock opera .  writer-director-star john cameron mitchell and composer-lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner .  mitchell stars as hedwig , a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u . s . coffee shops with her pan-slavic band , the angry inch .  while the patrons of the run-down restaurants look on in shock , and sometimes horror , hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song .  she was once a boy named hansel ( ben mayer-goodman ) , living with his mother ( alberta watson ) and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio .  life is an exercise in duality for hansel .  a wall splits his hometown into two parts .  mother describes love as the emotion that comes when you find your other half .  as hansel grows up , the duality becomes more pronounced .  after initially mistaking him for a girl , a gi from the states ( maurice dean wint ) falls in love with hansel and wants to marry him .  alas , hansel will never pass the mandatory physical .  mother helpfully suggests a sex change , but the operation goes bad , hence the references to " the angry inch " ( yes , i know this part is squirm-inducing , but stick with me - it's worth it ) .  several years later , mr . right is long gone and hansel becomes hedwig , decked out in a farrah fawcett-style wig and fronting a band made up of korean women .  hedwig finds a new love in tommy ( michael pitt ) , a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity .  but tommy does hedwig wrong , stealing her songs and becoming a superstar .  cut to the present .  tommy gnosis' stadium tour is thriving and hedwig is suing him .  despite warnings from her manager ( andrea martin ) that she could easily be labeled a stalker , hegwig and her new band , the angry inch , continue their coffee shop tour , shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in .  if this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical , take a few seconds and consider the plotlines of " tommy " and " rocky horror . "  as hedwig , john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and turning her into a compelling human being .  mitchell has world-class style and vocal chords to match .  even though the backstory is unusually strong , mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost a rock musical .  everything is propelled by one terrific song after another and , trust me , these are full-fledged rock songs , not the over-processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals .  while mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film , there is much of interest on the sidelines .  miriam shor does fine work as yitzhak , hedwig's lover and bandmate , conveying a great deal through expressions alone .  decked out in a bandanna and a surprisingly convincing beard , she makes a mighty attractive man .  as always , " sctv " veteran andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy , the angelic-appearing little rat .  artist emily hubley adds to the magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining the central themes of the musical .   " hedwig and the angry inch " surrounds a weird , funny and touching story with a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast .  true originals do not come along very often ? don't let this slip out of town without seeing it .  
1 the rocky horror picture show 'special edition' ( 1975 )  starring : tim curry and susan sarandon  cult films are never mainstream .  the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused , yelling out 'what the hell is that ? ' .  fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the 'hidden jokes' they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like they're insane .  the rocky horror picture show , recently re-released in a 'special edition' to video , is the mother of all cult films .  period .  like some other cult films , most notably little shop of horrors , the rocky horror picture show is a musical with a twisted edge to it .  this movie begins out innocently enough- a couple get engaged at a friend's wedding and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while it's raining .  they go to a castle to try to use the phone .  little do they know that the castle is owned by dr . frank n . furter , a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use for personal reasons .  the acting is pretty good overall .  tim curry ( home alone 2 , legend ) is over-the-top as frank n . furter .  it's interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandon's ( dead man walking ) first film- she plays janet , the girlfriend of brad majors .  even the singer meatloaf is in it ! !  the songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way .  a sampling of titles range from damn it , janet to touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me .  all the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors- kind of a bad thing .  barry bostwick ( brad majors ) tries to sing as does susan sarandon , but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience .  meatloaf sings like meatloaf .  the new special edition contains two original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the original version .  sadly , the songs are tacked after the credits- kind of defeats the purpose .  if you want to see a different film , watch this one ! !  
0 susan granger's review of " american outlaws " ( warner bros . )  thomas edison's " the great train robbery " ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and " jesse james under the black flag " ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero .  now , more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later , jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend .  the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , cole and scott younger ( scott caan , will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ) , after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war , return to liberty , missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown .  and an avaricious east coast railroad baron , thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) , is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value , aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who , back then , were just thugs who provided security .  but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims , jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith , ty o'neal , joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines , sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept .  plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal , lee mimms ( ali larter ) .  working from a politically-correct , clich ? -drenched , sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers , director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can .  the choppy editing hurts but russell boyd's cinematography , luke reichle's designer duds and trevor rabin's music lend authenticity .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " american outlaws " is a galloping , formulaic 3 .  it's the wild west re-visited as a date movie .  
1 synopsis : upper middle class , suburban family man lester ( kevin spacey ) realizes that he is just going through the motions : he is unable to feel passion ; he is soulless , cynical , and no longer able to feel the edge between success and failure .  everyone else around him has similar symptoms .  lester's unassertive daughter jane ( thora birch ) is too lethargic to change her world , yet all too ready to whine and complain .  his wife carolyn ( annette bening ) is reduced to keeping up appearances and reciting commercialist slogans .  and these are people with a big house and a decent standard of living .  the only person who seems able to appreciate beauty and freedom and life is the person most deprived of it : a dope-dealing teen from across the street who is practically imprisoned by a domineering , bullying father .  when lester embarks on a mad scramble to feel the edge again , the fact that he has quit his job to feel what it's like - - and his newfound interest in exercise to impress a teenage girl - - ruffle a lot of feathers in the family .  will lester regain his ability to appreciate life ?  opinion : people say it all the time : you never appreciate good health until it's gone .  likewise , people raised in fabulously pampered prosperity can become unhappy and spiteful over the dumbest , most inconsequential problems , simply because they have no clue how good they have it .  sometimes it takes a near fall - - accidentally or through deliberate fasting - - to move out of apathy and reclaim your ability to challenge the world .  the deprivation/appreciation cycle is a major theme of american beauty .  american beauty is a non-formula , intelligent and articulate movie that offers fantastic performances by everyone in the cast , especially kevin spacey , who is simply gosh darn amazing this movie .  the thing i like about american beauty is that there is no sentimental music , no hospital scene nor any overly dramatic hokum .  the movie entertains and offers brilliant performances just as is .  if you are in the mood for a thoughtful , non-formula flick , i highly recommend american beauty .  
1 once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end-of-the-world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon .  here we are now , just a few months later , and they're at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug's life .  what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution .  i mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ?  as was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior .  in fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything .  but it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison .  a bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs .  in fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining .  i haven't had such a good time at the movies in months .  it tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker .  the ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers .  just before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead .  flick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them .  he heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) .  flick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position .  the most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation .  created by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen .  the bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action .  this is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative .  the film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) .  but the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters .  flick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story .  but the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar .  all of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory .  in my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence .  in concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it .  with such strong work in both animation and script , a bug's life is nothing but a joy to sit through .  it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience .  after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it's downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty .  
0 blatantly borrowing elements from 1993's " like water for chocolate " and 1991's " the butcher's wife , " " simply irresistible " attempts to be a whimsical romantic comedy but , more often than not , comes off as laughable , leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar ( t . v . 's " buffy , the vampire slayer " ) would choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her time on .  things get off to a bad start right from the onset as amanda ( sarah michelle gellar ) , a young woman who runs her late family's struggling new york restaurant , runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of crabs on her and then vansihes into thin air .  while out shopping , she also meets tom ( sean patrick flanery ) , a charming , handsome man , who happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant for the department store he works for , and later when he decides to drop by her dive , called southern cross , for lunch , she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for him , even though she is known to not be a very good chef .  suddenly , amanda finds her restaurant , on the edge of foreclosure , rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food , which strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation when it hits their mouths .  are amanda and tom destined to be together ?  and is it not just because of the magical food , but because they really , truly like each other ?  and what exactly is going on with the food she is making ?  does it have anything to do with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen somehow assisting her in her food preparation ?   " simply irresistible " is a ridiculous and just plain goofy romantic fantasy that's as flimsy as a slice of bologna .  it takes one joke---that people who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual ways---and recycles it over and over again until the film has reached an appropriate running time of 95 minutes .  add in a music montage every ten minutes ( these are actually the best scenes in the movie , which certainly tells you something about the film itself ) , and what you've got is an utterly empty , if not necessarily boring , excursion .  the cast of " simply irresistible " is fairly good , but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting .  patricia clarkson ( 1998's " high art , " in which she played a drugged-out lesbian ) is a standout as tom's colleague , and is thankfully given a few funny lines of dialogue .  also of note is larry gilliard jr . , as amanda's cooking assistant and buddy , who is allowed to create a seemingly full character out of only a handful of scenes .  of the main stars , sarah michelle gellar is fine , but really does often look like she's struggling through the unmistakably clumsy material , and if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career in the future , he has certainly got to pick better projects than this .  the bottom line is that " simply irresistible " is the exact opposite of its deprophesized title , and when the movie got to the point where the characters began to float in mid-air ( an unamusing plot device that was repeated in the stupid last scene ) , my mind checked out from the characters and the romance .  when i think about it in hindsight , i should have checked out in the very first scene , where the point of the action was for gellar to crawl under tables looking for a runaway mechanical crab .  now , that certainly is what i'd call magical !  
0 if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell's infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat .  so when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) .  my , how easily does the worm turn .  hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics .  at the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included .  and with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . .  boring .  although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness .  _54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender .  these characters are about as generic as those descriptions .  in focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat .  with the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow's feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she's a peripheral character at best ) .  as such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ .  what is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ?  even whit stillman's _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene .  dancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher's fault .  from what i've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54's legend .  but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film .  aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored .  shane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold .  this tacked-on " romance " would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience .  they fail on both counts .  ultimately , _54_'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n .  as in , there isn't any to be had for the audience .  too much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place .  anyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively .  when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn't get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film's conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) .  strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying .  there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them .  they're on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 .  these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there's still a great disco movie to be made .  the problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course .  
0 one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles .  he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star .  after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us-mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film .  unfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for .  we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do .  then the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is .  the plot of men with guns can be summarized " in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas .  dr . fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went .  and he found out again and again and again . "  of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell .  a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians .  but the film talks down to the viewer .  dr . fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country .  he has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios .  fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service .  then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy .  in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others .  the student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not be a good place to be .  fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general .  the results are little different than one would expect .  dr . fuentes starts out incredibly naive .  even some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains .  but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was .  sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians .  the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences .  federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos .  damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter .  mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer .  
0 violence is bad .  violence is ugly .  violence breeds yet more violence .  kids , don't try this at home .  this weighty message isn't the only barrier to enjoying brother , but it's certainly one of the largest .  written , directed by , and starring the infamous takeshi kitano ( kikujiro , sonatine ) brother is his first film made outside his familial japan , bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles .   ( yakuza translated for the average american is the japanese mafia . )  if you piss a " family " member off , or dishonor yourself in any way , the usual punishment is public display of self-mutilation , usually resulting in the loss of limbs .  a definition of dishonor can be anything from making a stupid decision to leaving one family for another .  it would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs come from .  unfortunately the film doesn't give too much of an explanation , assuming its audience is aware of kitano's earlier work .  there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members , leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something , but you never know what .  then there's a scene in which a man kills himself in front of a rival in exchange for that rival joining the family .  granted , this is one of the best scenes in the movie , but it doesn't make a lot of sense .  instead , the two hours are basically spent watching the following : people go out and shoot each other , talk about it for ten-plus minutes , then go out and do it again .  the consistently repetitive discussion of territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning .  there are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose .  all of the sudden yamamoto ( kitano ) has a girlfriend .  he barely speaks to her , treats her like crap , and then sends her away .  another missed opportunity , considering it is such a big deal for kitano to bring his magic to the united states , is the combination of cultures , which rely too heavily on overused stereotypes .  though slow moving , brother does have good elements .  the action scenes are well directed , clearly defined , and interesting to watch .  some of the violence is more hinted at than shown , which produces the luscious squirm that one goes to see such films for .  the actors would be more enticing if they had more to do .  shirase's ( masaya kato ) loud , sarcastic coolness set against yamamoto's quietly threatening attitude is truly an entertaining combination .  their moments together or apart steal the rest of the show .  also to its credit , brother tackles the cause and effect of crime with realism .  a life of crime is easy to get sucked into with the first reward of quick cash .  sure people get rich , but they can also lose just as easily .  it's a great moral , with a great cast , just not much substance to back it up .  
0 bad movies described as " a swift descent into sinful pleasure , decay , and debauchery " are hard to watch .  bad 2000's movies that resemble bad 1980s films are even harder to watch .  shadow hours falls into the latter category , a mish-mashed train wreck of b-movie actors ( including michael dorn , aka star trek's worf ) , an uninteresting plot , vain attempts at capitalizing on the " underground " scenes of seedy los angeles , and really , really bad directing and horrendous music video-esque ballistic editing that was taught to me in film school right before i decided to drop out .  the film revolves around the life of michael holloway ( balthazar getty ) who is trying to restart his life with his one-dimensional wife chloe ( rebecca gayheart ) after a nasty bout of drug and alcohol addictions .  michael takes a job of working the graveyard shift at the local gas station and is bombarded by the ugliness and weirdness of the nightlife of l . a . one night , he meets a strange gent named stuart ( mr . buckaroo banzai , peter weller ) .  he drives a porsche , smokes french cigarettes , and drones on about life , eventually coaxing mike into exploring the " underbelly " of l . a . together , a tour of punk bars , s&m clubs , and bare-knuckle fights .  the film then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played peter greene , acting like he wants to get the chance at a reprisal of his role in the mask 2 . the film then simply dissolves into a cheap rip-off of dante's inferno mixed with an old stephen j . cannell television pilot .  the pace of the film is jarring and utterly without focus .  other horrors include the endless montages of people pumping gas and the charlie sheen , johnny depp , richard grieco-esque acting of balthazar getty .  peter weller clearly knows his career is completely gone and doesn't give two shits about it .  and after the cheap exploitation of bondage clubs , dance clubs , and brothels - damn , isn't anyone safe any more from the ugly eye of hollywood ! ?  way back in 1984 , a great but crazy director named abel ferrara made his worse film and called it fear city .  shadow hours reminds me of an almost perfect sequel .  director/writer : isaac eaton producers : peter alevey , andrea mia , shon greenblatt , balthazar getty starring : balthazar getty , peter weller , rebecca gayheart , peter greene , frederic forrest , brad douriff , michael dorn  
0 wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions .  over black and white drawings , we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange , sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation-induced mutation .  the " original " inhabitants of the earth , fairies and elves , return to populate the globe , along with their evil , mutant counterparts .  one day ( and i say " one day " not to be trite , but because that's exactly how it happened - no advance notice ) , a fairy queen gives birth to twins , one good and one evil .  the twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire .  we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology .  as unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out .  there's a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world , after all .  i soon learned , however , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film .  once the transition was made from still art to color animation , an entirely different feel takes precedence .  rather than the epic saga promised by the narration , we get a goofy-looking world of a saturday morning cartoon .  not just the look , mind you , but all the zany sounds like >honk boing  for years , blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good , since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined .  however , blackwolf now has a secret weapon : nazis .  yup , adolf hitler , the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht .  okay , not the real things , but an archival film his minions dug up .  projected into the sky for all to see , it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up .  before you know it , there are dead elves everywhere .  this is just as well .  the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn't care about any of them .  they're either silly , sappy , or both .  the dialog gets much of the credit for this .  an example is when avatar nonchalantly says , " well , looks like my brother and i begin our final battle . "  not very formidable when he's also the guy who says , " this is the biggest bummer of a trip i've ever been on . "  my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can't fight back against the nazi-charged evil .  her response is , " they have weapons and technology .  we just have love . "  suffice to say , the characters are strictly two-dimensional , and we therefore don't expect anything more than the obvious to happen .  which it does .  the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out , which is anticlimactic and disappointing .  please note that it is the action that is unexpected .  that it is disappointing is not .  the film couldn't settle on a particular mood .  it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle .  scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity .  the dramatics , which seem to occur at random , are overly staged and overly acted , detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned .  ralph bakshi , the director , makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film : hitler and the nazis were bad .  so who doesn't know this already ?  well , maybe children .  okay , so you might say that this is a movie for children .  it's not .  in the scenes where good fights evil , there's a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they're watching a cartoon .  so is the film for adults ?  if so , we probably don't need to be bashed over the head to get the point .  why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know ?  wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes , and hitler giving speeches .  however , we don't see any reason why they should be considered bad .  we see no atrocities being committed , not even any real battle footage .  there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich , and we're not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place .  this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made , since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment .  i'd like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere , at any time , and we must therefore be vigilant .  however , i'm not sure if i want to give him that much credit .  
1 cinema has been around for about a hundred years now . ?  it's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time .  recently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others .   ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius . ?  they are likely to be remembered for .   .   .  well , quite a while . ?  i like this film , too . ?  yes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie . ?  true , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime . ?  and there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money . ?  in fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable .  i certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through .  of course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together .  the story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters .  yes , you read that right .  armageddon actually has characters you can care about !  if you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be .  if you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story .  it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film .  so , it's up to the u . s . government to stop it .   ( why the u . s . is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . )  their plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within .  the head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) .  his group of men is a colorful bunch , including a . j .   ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) .  there's also an interesting triangle formed between a . j . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter .  a . j .  and grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation .  it's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon .  it's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff .  it's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens .  but bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better .  i think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles .  take the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york .  a meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars .  the action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways .  i like his quick-edit style , because it's abrasive and exhausting to watch .  it's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times .  but it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes .  the special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame .  deep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable .  special effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn't work .  everything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid .  the effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art .  of course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action .  the film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action .  much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters' subplots .  i won't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions aren't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way .  in fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story .  bruce willis is terrific , and i'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) .  tyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level .  patton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving .  the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny .  i wasn't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don't mind too much .  but the film doesn't insult my intelligence -- it's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do .  it's not mindless and escapist , but well-crafted cinema .  it might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget .  i'm not saying that films like this are risky moves .  what i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms .  
0 it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar .  why ?  the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey' .  i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were expecting another `armageddon' .  but no , `mission to mars' certainly isn't one large action sequence about colossal disaster .  this is a supposedly thoughtful , family-friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel .  you have been warned .  of course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see `apollo 13' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation .  brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off .  when he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like `the untouchables' or `mission : impossible' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally ) .  of course , there's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including `snake eyes' and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities' ) . . . .  all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood .  that term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient .  if i were gary sinise , i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole .  sinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in `snake eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham , i'm sure he wouldn't want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration .  the academy award-winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 ) .  after a barbecue get-together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet .  suddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a `sand tornado' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction .  for some reason , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this , as if it were a lovely piece of art .  the team is killed within seconds , expect for luc , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive .  immediately , a second mission - consisting of astronauts mcconnell , husband and wife woody and terri blake ( tim robbins and connie nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) - are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars .  let's put the `secret' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there .  it is explained , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not ) , that a trip to mars takes roughly six months .  i'm not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind `m2m' didn't capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia .  instead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship .  what happened during the five months prior to this ?  did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ?  still , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie ) during the time-frame involving a fuel leak .  depalma's direction is quite good in these scenes , although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space ?  c'mon ) .  there's a few good , imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese , a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud .  it's a colossal bummer that `mission to mars' is poorly assembled and laughably written , with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists .  as mentioned before , anyone looking for some disaster-movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed . . .  maybe even cheated .  after the unbelievably hokey final shot ( with the words ? the end' somehow adding insult to injury ) , a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen .  others muttered obscenities , shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling `jeez , that sucked . '  okay , it did suck .  but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy . . .  after all , they do pretty well .  sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes , robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple , and funnyman o'connell - well , he has a couple lines are actually amusing ( and intentionally so ) .  the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive .  so , by golly , where did this `mission' go wrong ?  looking back on the appalling experience , i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have .  while watching `mission to mars' , my suggestion would be to immediately abort , or better yet , don't even strap yourself in for lift-off .  
1 plot : a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side .  but this new guy is not like all the others , he's got ambition , he's got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster .  violence , lots of swearing and betrayals ensue .  critique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the " great " mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending .  here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix .  okay , so it's not entirely new , but it's definitely original when all put together as done here .  the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place .  it's 1968 and these dudes are looking good !  yes , it's all about the suits , fellas . . . the  italian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that's ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you .  here are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place .  but that's not the basis of this movie .  the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other .  you know how there are always these " hanger-on " gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ?  well , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person . . . that  is , their boss .  so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence .  but this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package .  of course , director paul mcguigan isn't trying to be guy ritchie here , and doesn't over-stylize his presentation , jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix .  nope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this .  the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he's attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty !   ( " look into my eyes ! " )  in fact , the last time that i've seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers' miller's crossing .  scary shite .  but there's an ever better scene than that in this film .  this one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man's point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that's right , he " does " the guy in his underwear ) .  that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? ) .  but the flick's not perfect .  in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot .  all he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( " . . . so  i opened the door , then went up the lift , etc . . . . " -it's  like , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! !  overdone . ) .  i also didn't quite " buy " the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it's supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ? ? ! ?  i mean , c'mon . . . it's 30 years , man ! !  i don't know , somehow it didn't work all that well for me .  but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies , and this one is a decent addition to the lot .  forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell's narration of the obvious plot points , and concentrate on the film's stronger attributes such as its style , the exquisite atmosphere of the time period , its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group , its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads , bettany and thewlis .  incidentally , unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below , this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films . . . it's the real deal !  note : this film is packed with strong accents all around , which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time .  it's also quite violent and i don't remember any film that used the c-word as much as this one , so leave the kids at home for this one . . .   ; )  where's joblo coming from ?  american psycho ( 10/10 ) - a clockwork orange ( 9/10 ) - donnie brasco ( 8/10 ) - fight club ( 10/10 ) - get carter ( 7/10 ) - godfather ( 10/10 ) - godfather ii ( 10/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 ) - lock , stock & two smoking barrels ( 8/10 ) - pulp fiction ( 8/10 ) - reservoir dogs ( 9/10 )  
1 magnolia left me relling from the theatre , staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft .  at nearly three and a half hours , magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film .  it not only demands your attention , but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions .  it is delirious , depressing , heady , pretentious , surreal filmmaking .  it's also a movie that will polarize its viewers .  director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast , wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn't let up until an oddly exhilerating , biblically influenced pseudo-climax .  the character's make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives .  there is frank mackey ( tom cruise ) , a slithery snake charmer of men whose " search and destroy " seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants .  there is earl partridge ( jason robards ) , a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son .  there is game show host jimmy gator ( phillip baker hall ) , a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public .  and there is police officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) , who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system , perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process .  given equal weight are stories involving a coke-addled emotional cripple ( melora walters ) , a former tv quiz show champion ( william h . macy ) .  a materialistic , adulterous wife ( julianne moore ) , a child ( jeremy blackman ) victimized by a mentally abusive parent , and a caring , empathetic nurse ( philip seymour hoffman ) .  hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death , lies and despair .  it is not a pleasant movie .  there is not one bad note in the acting .  it is affecting and layered and wonderful .  there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films .  then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene .  walters plays her character with red-eyed rawness and a fierce self-destructiveness that is anxiety inducing .  robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man , who still hears a lion's roar when he speaks .  director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote .  the problem is that he stays on them too long .  julianne moore's character , linda , quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt , tears , screaming and remorse and never backs off from it .  after a few hours , it turns from interesting to chinese water torture .  quite a few scenes , such as the game show , go on just a bit too long and will be off-putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around .  and just what is the theme ?  alienation ?  hopelessness ?  anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn't make it easy .  the film starts by showing three , strange and seemingly unrelated events .  it's a harbinger of the synchronicity to come .  at times , different stories reach reach key moments at the same time .  other times , stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory , regardless of what else is happening .  anderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film !  what's surprising is that it mostly works .  if you have doubts about anderson's intentions , i'll ask you to pay attention to the final frame .  despite all the sturm und drang , magnolia ultimately speaks to man's capacity for hope and attempts at redemption .  despite magnolia's needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur , showing off fro the masses , i have to admire his guts .  this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling .  my rating : a bulleye .   ( stars )  a side note : helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann .  her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful .  when she sings " save me " at the end , it enhances the yearning felt by the characters , just as " wise up " mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives .  
1 i'll be the first to admit i didn't expect much from the emperor's new groove : more celine dion-esque song-and-dance numbers , cuddly characters that become cross-promotion devices in mcdonald's happy meals , and hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice-over job to their resume .  i was dead wrong about all of those things .  the emperor's new groove is funny .  damn funny .  and the cute characters in the film are the dangerous ones .  the script is fast and furious , with no singing and dancing .  the animation is clean and would give walt a warm feeling all over .  the humor is dry and aimed at both the cynicism and the goodness in all of us .  the story is ridiculously weird and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking , cross-dressing llamas and schizophrenia .  here's the plot ; try to follow along .  set in a mythical kingdom , the film follows the adventures of kuzco ( david spade ) , an arrogant and egocentric emperor .  when kuzco fires his power-hungry advisor , yzma ( eartha kitt ) , she and her " assistant " kronk ( seinfeld's patrick warburton ) change him into a llama .  kuzco then gets stranded in the jungle and must rely on pacha ( john goodman ) , a llama-herder whose home was to be replaced by kuzco's water world theme park , to save him .  then the fun starts .  for the next sixty minutes , the audience is treated to something unheard of in disney films these days : imagination .  yzma , voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt , looks like a cross between norma desmond , joan crawford , and a really old vegas showgirl .  the dialogue between her and her oblivious assistant kronk is quick , sharp , and feels like an episode of seinfeld ( which would make sense ) .  david spade and john goodman's character interactions make you feel like you're watching an old hope/crosby film .  spade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots below the belt on several occasions , and i laughed out loud several times .  needless to say , that is an extremely rare thing in disney screenings these days .  the best part about the emperor's new groove is how audacious the film is .  the sheer weirdness factor is very high .  cross-dressing , schizophrenia , duality of soul , people being turned into every animal on noah's boat , llama cpr , homoerotic tendencies , an emperor with his own theme song and singer , michael jackson dance moves , and a guy that can communicate with a squirrel are only a few of the oddities that make the film a true orginal .  simply put , the emperor's new groove is one of the best children's films out for this holiday season .  kids will enjoy the adventures , and parents will enjoy the story and dialogue .  that's a tough thing to pull off in a single package , but this emperor manages to do it .  
0  " be gentle , " urges natasha henstridge to matthew perry in " the whole nine yards . "   " i haven't made love in five years . "   " neither have i , " rebuts perry .   " i'm married ! "  if jonathan lynn's latest comedy relied simply on jokes of that caliber--and it certainly tries--then it'd be an innocuous if rather obvious little film .  instead , its failings go much deeper .  first off , who hasn't had enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy genre ?  if you want to make a pretty penny or two in hollywood nowadays simply write a " comedy " which pairs a robert de niro/james caan/bruce willis type with a billy crystal/hugh grant/matthew perry type and wait for the royalties to roll in .  who's next ?  jack nicholson and martin short ?  it certainly doesn't have to be funny .   " the whole nine yards " is not a particularly funny film , but it is borderline offensive .  offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldn't think twice about pushing your mother-in-law off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete .  that might sound like a funny sight gag , but the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fact that taking a human life isn't all that funny to begin with .  when the corpse is placed in a car , doused with gasoline , set ablaze and referred to as " barbecue , " it makes you wonder when all this playing killing for laughs is going to end .   " the whole nine yards " is also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects .  rosanna arquette plays a slutty , chain-smoking french canadian who's married to matthew perry's none-too-successful dentist .  it's an unflattering role made all the more so by the unflattering outfits--and unflattering situations--into which arquette is thrust .  then there's natasha henstridge ( " species " i and ii ) who plays the well-to-do wife of contract killer bruce willis .  she gets involved with perry's character when he comes to chicago hoping to negotiate a finder's fee with mob boss yanni gogolack ( kevin pollack , transposing his vs with his ws ) after willis' jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next door .  henstridge and perry's characters hitting it off is about as likely as bruce and demi getting back together .  perry might have the charm but he doesn't have the physical attributes of a traditional leading man , especially in close-up .  most objectified of the bunch is amanda peet , who turns in a sexually-ripe performance as perry's dental assistant with , it transpires , questionable career goals .  peet's gratuitous nude scene proves how low this movie will stoop to keep its audience from dropping off .  when " my cousin vinny " is the highpoint of a directorial career including such forgettable films as " clue , " " greedy , " and " sgt .  bilko , " you have to wonder if lynn chose the wrong career path .  perry's pratfalling goofiness coupled with willis' likable hardness could have had some potential but with no script to work with , and a director who seems to be watching from the wings , their characters run out of gas quickly .  
0 movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting , entertaining or convincing , because of one fundamental reason : movies are made by adults and not teenagers .  occasionally , however , films like say anything , dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called " teenagers . "  can't hardly wait , however , does not .  instead , the writing/directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich ? found in the teenage genre , strip it completely of perception , intelligence and wit - and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to .  can't hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation .  the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them : there's the average male protagonist preston ( ethan embry ) , prom queen and cheerleader amanda ( jennifer love-hewitt ) , football star mike ( peter facinelli ) , white rapper wannabe kenny ( seth green ) , computer geek william ( charlie korsmo ) , and brainy outsider denise ( lauren ambrose ) .  i couldn't stand any of those characters .  whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming " yo , i gotta have sex tonight ! " ,  all i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film .  apparently , can't hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy , but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it's not funny .  in all honesty , elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour .  and when i say " forced " , i mean it .  they should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange .  this is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour .  for instance , can't hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as " i am a sex machine . "  for some reason , elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough , eventually it will be funny .  if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk - now that's funny .  
0 has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears ?  nineteen years and two mighty ducks later , the formula is still going strong .  police academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a small-town deputy sheriff corralled into co-coaching the school's hastily formed soccer team .  his partner-in-crime is the new british " exchange teacher " ( olivia d'abo ) , a lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds and knows that the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested , outer-city audience is to teach them something neat .  like soccer .  most of the good-natured gags are of the fast-motion variety , such as runaway cows and out-of-control lawnmowers .  kids will laugh at the occasional belching bit , while their parents peacefully doze beside them .  other than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed , what's missing from the big green is a better integration of music and comedy .  instead of a peppy pop score , which would arguably work to better effect , most of the action is set to a bombastic orchestral score that belongs somewhere else .  comedy needs music .  just watch any old bugs bunny short .  the marx brothers knew it .  mel brooks knows it .  unfortunately , the current trend is to " overscore . "  lush strings and booming brass in every scene , at every moment .  remember the simple strains of bizet's " habanera " in the original bad news bears ?  these days , it's usually a bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene in its path .  much like adding frosting to already frosted cake .  an awfully big adventure ========================  the reteaming of director mike newell and star hugh grant is about as far removed as you can get from the lightsome comedy of four weddings and a funeral .  their second collaboration is a downbeat theatrical drama about a young intern ( georgina cates ) struggling to survive in post-w . w . ii  liverpool .  hugh plays the gay director , an * extremely * unappealing character who may alienate whatever fans are left after the nonsense of nine months .  bleak make-up and thick accents conspire to make this a difficult story to settle into .  an awful adventure is not without * some * rewards , tho .  the peter pan subtext is intriguing .  as is the diverse ensemble cast that includes peter firth , alan rickman , and prunella scales .  basil !  devil in a blue dress =====================  the comparisons to chinatown are easy enough , except for the fact that this film isn't nearly as gripping .  writer/director carl franklin ( one false move ) is the force behind this accomplished-but-stiff adaptation of walter mosley's crime novel .  denzel washington is as sturdy as ever , but he's burdened with a miscast supporting cast .  tom sizemore and scene-stealer don cheadle are both fine .  the problems start with jennifer beales , who never registers as the plot's femme fatale .  she's a pretty face and nothing more .  also underweight are maury chaykin and terry kinney .  they play opposing mayoral candidates in 1948 los angeles and neither actor commands enough authority to stifle giggles .  john huston , we miss you !  fine period detail and a strong sense of humor are a plus .  they help to overcome a pace that's too polite for mosley's jazzy , swingin' story .  steal big , steal little =======================  i can't say much about this one .  director andrew davis follows the fugitive with a wildly unfunny farce about twin brothers ( andy garcia ) with opposing moral codes .  they're fighting over their adoptive mother's estate , a 40 , 000-acre ranch worth millions and supporting dozens of migrant farm workers .  so many different plots are trying to come together--feuding brothers , reconciling husbands , loan-shark hired hitmen--that you have to admire the director's ambition .  too bad that almost every single person or plot-line is out of sync .  that is , with the exception of alan arkin .  he's the best thing in a movie that--despite the work of four credited writers-- * still * manages to waste such diverse talents as david odgen stiers , kevin mccarthy , and joe pantolinao .  and what the heck does that title mean ?  
1 titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it's upsetting that it isn't .  the film , which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film .  we all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic .  but sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron's best films )  the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic .  they find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman .  the woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her .  the explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic .  in the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america .  also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen't love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich .  she nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them .  oh yeah , and the ship sinks .  and that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius .  the story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak .  the story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck-up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in-jokes of how the boat won't sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it's a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film .  without good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear .  firstly , there's cameron's direction .  there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic .  but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end .  there is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron .  it's a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below .  thanks to cameron's direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes .  to support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters .  dicaprio is good , although he only looks 16-17 years old .  his performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines .  winslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth .  zane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash .  the audience really does come to hate him .  he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he's in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well .  also worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american .  finally , the icing on the 'great things' cake are the special effects .  cameron is a whiz with effects ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and they are used very well throughout .  the sweeps of the ships are awesome , although digital domain , who did the effects , cannot animate human movement too well .  the humans seem to move to 'smoothly' , there's just something odd about them .  you can tell that they have been animated on a computer .  of course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed .  titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film .  titanic , then , is a wonder of directing , acting and cgi , but not writing and story .  again , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts .  titanic , then , although not the godfather of movies it could of been , is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius .  enjoyable , scary , and even sad , titanic is a film cinema was invented for , filling the screen with incredible images , and assaulting the ears with awesome sound .  a superb film , but sadly not perfect .  overall rating= (  
0 i think that saying that the x-files is one of this summer's most anticipated films is safe .  for five years , " the x-files " television show has developed a dedicated fan culture , whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of " star trek " fans .  the premise of both the movie and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal ; fox mulder ( david duchovny ) is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders on the paranoid , and dana scully ( gillian anderson ) is the scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulder's flights of fancy .  outlining the plot of the x-files movie is virtually impossible , since to be general would result in confusion , yet to be specific would give too much away .  nevertheless , i will try .   " the black ooze , " and extraterrestrial , virus-like substance is threatening earth .  a " shadow government " is aware of this , but tries to cover-up the alien existence .  mulder and scully know " the truth is out there , " and so try to expose both the invasion and the cover-up .  there are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie : 1 .  will those who don't watch the series be able to understand the movie ?  yes .  isolated as an individual text , the x-files can stand alone .  they have given enough background for anyone , familiar with the show or not , to understand the movie .  although some of the secondary characters' histories may confuse the uninitiated , those characters are not essential to the film .  this is a major problem : they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance and then disappear just as quickly .  why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the first place , and then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee ?  why bring in " the lone gunmen , " three computer geek conspiracy theorists , for an even briefer appearance ?  these characters are recurrent on the series , and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience ( suggesting their popularity among fans - actually most of the audience could pass for " the lone gunmen " ) .  still , then they vanish just as quickly .  2 . the television show never gives us any answers .  will the movie actually explain some things ?  yes .  in the x-files we get a fairly complete history of " the black ooze , " what it is and what it wants .  we finally get some understanding of the motivations behind the " shadow government .

&nbsp ;  why bring in " the lone gunmen , " three computer geek conspiracy theorists , for an even briefer appearance ? &nbsp ;  these characters are recurrent on the series , and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience ( suggesting their popularity among fans - actually most of the audience could pass for " the lone gunmen " ) . &nbsp ;  still , then they vanish just as quickly .  &nbsp ; 2 . &nbsp ;  the television show never gives us any answers . &nbsp ;  will the movie actually explain some things ? &nbsp ;  yes . &nbsp ;  in the x-files we get a fairly complete history of " the black ooze , " what it is and what it wants . &nbsp ;  we finally get some understanding of the motivations behind the " shadow government . " &nbsp ;  there are even some subtle tie-ins with contemporary ufo-ology , including the " greys " and the roswell crash of 1947 .  &nbsp ; 3 . &nbsp ;  is the movie any good ? &nbsp ;  no . &nbsp ; the x-files is a dreadful movie and shows some fundamental problems with writer/creator chris carter's talents and the relationship between cinema and television .  &nbsp ; first off , the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched . &nbsp ;  after approximately forty-five minutes ( the length of a television episode minus the commercials ) , the pace drops to a snail's crawl . &nbsp ;  not long after that point , when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series , we wish he had not . &nbsp ;  the explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much . &nbsp ;  i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit , but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much . &nbsp ;  breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie - and listening to other fans leave the cinema , maybe the series too .  &nbsp ; the explanations are not only absurd , they are tired and unoriginal . &nbsp ;  the extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series , and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day . &nbsp ;  note that the alien movies , id4 , and the x-files are all from 20thcentury fox - a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think .  &nbsp ; the x-files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running . &nbsp ;  in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge .  &nbsp ; the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people . &nbsp ;  however , i rather liked that about the series . &nbsp ;  television allows you to impose as much , or as little , meaning on a show as you want . &nbsp ;  it is the proverbial " blank screen " which we project our minds on . &nbsp ;  meaning on television is open and ambiguous ; it is the nature of the medium .  &nbsp ; cinema , on the other hand , is the opposite . &nbsp ;  it projects onto us the filmmakers mind . &nbsp ;  we can , in some films , fill the textual gaps ourselves , but that almost never happens in an american film . &nbsp ;  meaning , in cinema , needs to be self-contained and determined .  &nbsp ; so , when the x-files made that jump from small to big screen , carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well . &nbsp ;  he did not . &nbsp ;  by making explicit , what the television show left implicit , carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill .  &nbsp ; when they say that " fans " make a tv show , it is not far from the truth . &nbsp ;  on television , fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because there is nothing there . &nbsp ;  how true that is when we see the " explicit " x-files - there is nothing there .  
0 the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is .  it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously .  mr . gregg " i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis " araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world .  and how does he show it ?  by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this .  oh , and it gets better .  a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i'm not counting the several masturbation scenes ) .  in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of " do you ever wonder what life is all about ? "  sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus .  of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can't even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it's a cheap joke , but it had to be done ) .   " the doom generation " is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another " teen angst " film ( one of the slogans is " teen is a four-letter word " - hardy har har ) .  it's a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in " scream " ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid's son in " independence day " ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in " that thing you do ! "  - and by the way , do you get the symbolism ?  red , white , and blue ?  huh ?  huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them .  the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films .  gregg araki obviously has seen such films as " easy rider , " " natural born killers , " and " kalifornia , " and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide .  but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper .   " the doom generation " doesn't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level .  he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about .  here's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff .  amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out .  she tells him to fuck off or something to that note .  he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly .  jordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter .  the cash register rings up " 6 . 66 "   ( oh , and this symbolism doesn't stop here ) .  jordan checks for his wallet but it's really in the car .  he asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well .  the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money .  they say they don't have it .  he gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you ) .  the head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream .  i don't really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out .  araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he'll make some kind of art .  wrong .  it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art .  when george romero made " dawn of the dead , " a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick .  same goes for peter jackson's disgustingly gory " dead alive , " which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies .  it was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled .  a scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens .  here's a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances .  also , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn't really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn't when they signed to be in " caligula " ) .  people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher " peter brady " mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line .  why are they here ?  so that we can all point to them and say " hey , look it's ( fill in the blank ) !  wow ! "  gimme a break .  the film's meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there's a giant explosion of horrific violence .  otherwise defined as " teen angst , " or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you .  look , i'm 19 years old .  i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did .  i've since moved on to " i don't really know what to do with my life " phase , but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they're dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse .  part of being a teen is experimenting , and testing the waters .  it's not whining about how awful parents are , and purposely feeling dispondent .  this is what the characters in this film do , and the film wants to show how they're these great people who are being punished by the world because they're teenagers , and how they try to defend themselves but can't totally overcome them .  it's not their fault they kill people ; it's the world's !  what they really need is a reality check .  the world is a bad place , and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting .  but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it .  the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed , and there's nothing they can do about it .  hence the title .  not only does it have bad fallacy , but it can't even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner .  everything's overly surreal , and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex .  how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst ?  how does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way ?  and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film ?  if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction , he'd show them for what they really are .  and if he didn't want the satirical approach , he'd show the real problems with the world .  and if you still don't think that " the doom generation " is incompetent on every single possible level it could be , take the acting .  rose macgowan is horrible .  yes , she proved herself talented in " scream , " but she's so bad in " the doom generation " that if i had not seen her in " scream , " i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today .  her entire performance is one-note ( bitchy ) , and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it's laughable .  equally bad is jonathan schaech , who wants to be the slacker serial killer : someone who doesn't have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain .  his performance is annoying as hell , and granted , he was better in " that thing you do ! "  and then there's james duval .  let's just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando .  he has the same kind of slacker stuttering , only much much much worse , and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him " least talented actor in the world . "  i have seen lots of bad actors , but james duval has got to be the worst .  or at least somewhere up there .  here's another example of a bad scene , if you're still not convinced : the film opens up in a club where they're playing nine inch nail's most banal song , " heresy " ( example of the lines : " god is dead/and no one cares/if there is a hell/i'll see you there " ) , and as the song plays , and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing , the film pans over to amy , just standing there , looking dispondent .  the film closes in on her , she looks right at the camera and says " fuck . "  no explanation of this should be necessary .  and finally , a note to gregg : grow up .  really .  move out of your parent's basement , read something other than salinger , and get a day job .  and don't quit it .  
1 this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated .  there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood's most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story .  this is the best we've seen from disney since " beauty and the beast " ( 1996 ) .  this film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story .  in the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their " lives " .  one day , andy broke woody's arm off , while playing with him .  woody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards .  later andy's mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son's room .  since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back .  although his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale .  the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , " woody's roundup . "  if he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit .  so , after andy's mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it's up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend .  and so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys .  there are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) .  meanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) .  they offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan .  he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations .  the problem is , if woody escapes from al's clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage .  a real effort is made in the technical department .  the animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the " cinematography " is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close-ups that really make an impression .  lighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie's remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on " jurassic park " and " star wars " .  the film ends with the " failed takes " , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv .  these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film .  but what in the end makes " toy story 2 " a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation .  it is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself .  it is not difficult to predict that " toy story 2 " would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected .  unexpected because the first film wasn't much more than a demonstration of special effects .  but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn't produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs .  but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years .  this is a big step-away from the ancient laws of disney-animation .  off course , this is not " antz " , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you'll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have .  whether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say .  my choice would probably be " the iron giant " , but ( along side with " american pie " ) this is the comedy of the year .  i almost lost my hopes for disney , but " toy story 2 " proves that disney hasn't lost their ability to entertain .  
1 voices . . . . . trey parker , matt stone , george clooney , minnie driver .   " south park : bigger , longer and uncut " is undoubtedly crude , offensive , mean-spirited movie , that comes off as a politcally correct movie too .  if your canadian , a strong christian , fat , gay or anything else , you will be offended .  but when you watch this movie , there is no doubt that you will laugh .  based on the wildly popular comedy central tv show , south park stars cartman , an overweight , foul-mouthed kid , with attitude , and a sweet side .  kenny , a poor kid who gets killed in every episode , and talks with his coat hood covering his head .  stan a regular , sometimes boring kid who has problems with women .  and kyle a lonely jew who talks to his poop .  the movie opens with a funny , but messageable song , that all of the people of south park sing .  cartman , stan , kenny and kyle are very excited to see the new terrance and phillip ( beavis and butthead types ) movie " asses of fire " .  but when the kids get up to the movie to get the tickets , they learn the movie is rated r , which of course means that anyone under the age of 17 cannot get in without a parent or legal guardian .  the kids do not understand this , and they pay a homeless man to buy their tickets .  while in the movie , laughing at the movie , terrance and phillip cuss repeatedly entertaining the kids .  they kids then go out and cuss themselves , getting in trouble and causing kyle's mom to go against the mpaa .  while doing this kenny learns a thing or to , by proving to cartman he can light his fart on fire .  kenny does so , dies , and goes to hell , to find out that satan and saddam huiessan ( homosexual lovers ) , are about to take over the world , if terrance and phillip die .  >from here on , nothing more should be said to keep the rest a surprise .  but believe me , this isn't your regular south park tv show , and should not be seen by anyone under 14 or more .  this film contains extreme profanity ( over 130 " f " words and a collection of others ) .  but beyond being bad in a tasteless type way , south park : bigger , longer and uncut has many messages that are embedded inside it .  but i bet you will not leave the movie , for at least laughing one time or more .  and enjoying yourself .  take it from me , south park : b , l , and u , isn't as good as you'd hope , but it is good for some laughs .
