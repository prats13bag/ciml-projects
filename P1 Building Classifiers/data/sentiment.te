1 a thriller set in modern day seattle , that marked marky mark's migration from the " good vibrations " and " calvin klein undie ad " guy , to mark wahlberg , thespian-at-large , and a mighty good one at that .  plot : boy ( wahlberg ) meets girl ( witherspoon ) .  boy likes girl .  girl likes boy .  boy and girl begin dating .  parents of girl aren't crazy about the boy .  girl steps to boy's defense .  family problems occur .  girl learns more about the boy .  boy goes nuts .  fun ensues .  critique : ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love ?  well , if you ever have , then this film is definitely for you .  it isn't the most original premise in the world , but it is handled pretty well here , and pretty quickly for that matter ( a speedy 90 minutes ) .  i think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg ( of boogie nights infamy ( 7 . 5/10 ) .  he completely captured all the goodness , and badness , of the main character of this film , and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him ( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience , as " best villain " at the 1997 mtv movie awards ) .  the soundtrack is also very effective in this setting , and of course , the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in ( look for the nice bikini and butt shots . . . if  you're into that kind of thing , that is : ) .  i didn't much care for the father/david relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived , but for the most part , i was really into this movie .  then again , daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him what the " big deal " was about his daughter dating david .  his reply : " the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps , and the girl is my daughter . "  good point .  all in all , the movie kicked some fun ass , mindless as it was , and effectively demonstrated every parent's worst nightmare .  mind you , i still can't tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag , but hey , life goes on .  and on a personal note , we finally decided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual , and let me tell you all . . . it was a flaming success ! !  another firm recommendation by joe schmoe !  little known facts : director james foley was the man responsible for the critically acclaimed glengarry glenross ( 8/10 ) back in 1992 , at close range ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1986 , and even directed an episode of twin peaks in 1990 .  mark wahlberg stands 5 " 9 , is born in massachusetts , dropped out of highschool ( later got his ged ) , and was convicted of several minor felonies before starting his career as the lead singer of marky mark and the funky bunch .  his brother is donnie wahlberg of new kids on the block fame .  he is also testing the waters on the acting front .  
1 imagine this .  you're given a sword and a shield and very basic , minimal training .  a man you don't know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live .  you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die .  you frantically monitor several closed doors which , in seconds , will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you .  you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood .  if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you , you know you're going to have to do it all over again tomorrow .  eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are , you're going to die .  this is the life of a gladiator .  you'll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott's powerful gladiator , you'll be thankful for that .  with his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire .  and like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye-catching special effects , and a great script .  since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited .  >from a weak beginning , the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious .  rome's best general maximus ( russell crowe ) , who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted , is currently ( in the year 180 a . d . that is ) waging a war against germania .  scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style , similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective .  it's blurry , in slow motion , and the sound is muted .  as soon as this artistic method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who .  it's a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch .  instead , the general swears he will get out after this battle .  he wants to go back to his family and his crops , he wants a quiet life .  but , unexpectedly , he gets anything but that .  the dying emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies .  he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators .  all of this does not go well for aurelius' son , commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor .  jealous and upset , commodus kills his own father , names himself emperor , kills maximus' wife and son , and attempts to kill maximus .  but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius' wishes .  now a slave , the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator , who eventually are released for their success .  a story of betrayal and promises , gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick .  you actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way .  phoenix plays his character brilliantly .  think of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , " respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man " brat who hates when he's not the center of attention .  every scene we see commodus , he's either crying or he looks like he has just been crying .  phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for , and gladiator shows he's more than just river's little brother .  crowe is also excellent as the film's grisly-faced hero .  maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions .  this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act , he's no invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners , he ( believe it or not ) acts like a human being !  the rest of the cast , including richard harris , djimon hounsou , walter hill , derek jacobi , and connie nielsen are also first rate .  ridley scott , using outstanding special effects , has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum , the loudness of the roman mob , and the city of rome in general .  the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous , like a cleopatra of the year 2000 .  the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper-class politicians .  gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience .  along with u-571 , action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000 .  
0 tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers , all searching for deeper meaning .  however , they won't find much meaning in the real blonde , and not enough real humor , either .  joe ( matthew modine ) is a struggling actor , or he claims to be one , even though he has no credits under his belt .  his girlfriend , mary ( catherine keener ) has no pretensions about her career : she's a makeup artist , working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) and supermodel of the month , sahara ( bridgette wilson ) .  sahara , who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid , has an on-again , off-again relationship with joe's best friend , bob ( maxwell caulfield ) .  however , bob has gotten his biggest break yet : a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly ( daryl hannah ) , who may be that illusive woman he's always pursued : a real blonde .  there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde , but not enough .  the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background , such as sahara's perfume ads : " depression - it's not just a state of mind " .  but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel .  and , unfortunately , the film's forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic .  take for example the film's framing device of an old lady and her dog .  the story serves absolutely no purpose , makes little sense , and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie .  matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film , but they're stuck in the most boring plotlines .  modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley , who appears as another struggling actor .  keener's character has a stronger edge , but the insult self-defense class ( taught by denis leary , no less ) she is stuck in makes little sense .  the movie's running time is under two hours , but it seems like it is well over it .  there's just not enough humor to speed things along , and not enough meaning to propel any drama .  
0 say , tell me if you've seen this before : a crisis on-board a commercial airliner causes a stewardess to have to fly and land the plane herself .  airport '97 anyone ?  ray liotta is a psychotic serial killer being transported from new york to california on christmas eve .  amazingly , on what would seemingly be a busy day of travel on one of the most flown routes , only about six other passengers are on the flight .  anyway , they take off , liotta escapes and kills all the police and the pilots , and stewardess lauren holly locks herself in the cockpit to fly the plane .  the story is beyond routine , the script is embarrassing ( at one point , this jumbo jet is flying completely upside down ) , the characters are worthless , and the performances are annoying .  surprisingly , co-writer steven e . de souza actually wrote the first two " die hard " movies !   " turbulence " takes place at christmas time , yet the film was released a few days after the holidays .  brilliant marketing , as no one cares about anything having to do with christmas after december 26th .  the studio knew they had a bomb , and purposely dumped it out when the fewest number of people would see it .

1 a miracle of filmmaking , " some like it hot " is a brilliant film , and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists .  it is the pinnacle of writer-director billy wilder's career , a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make .  jerry ( lemmon ) and joe ( curtis ) are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig , trying to earn enough money to feed themselves .  one night , as they're playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy , the place is raided .  as it turns out , the owner , spats columbo ( george raft ) was ratted out by toothpick charlie ( george e . stone ) .  several weeks later , on valentine's day , jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage .  eager to escape , the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid .  the only catch . . its a girls band .  so josephine ( curtis ) and daphne ( lemmon ) , make their way onto the train and go to florida .  on the way there , they meet sugar kane ( monroe ) , a bombshell singer who is looking for love .  jerry and joe immediately fall for the singer , but there's two problems : 1 ) they're in drag , and 2 ) millionaire osgood fielding ( joe e . brown ) falls madly in love with daphne .  what follows in pure hysteria , still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the " italian opera lovers festival " .  tony curtis is hysterical as joe/josephine , especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar .  marilyn monroe , in a wonderfully comic performance , is sugar , providing incredible timing and sex appeal , along with true sincerity .  the scenes , however , are all stolen by either brown or lemmon .  lemmon is hysterical as daphne .  cast as the less rational one , lemmon's performance is ridiculously crazy , it is disorder in the style all billy wilder's .  brown is particularly hilarious as osgood , as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony .  he manages to use lemmon's ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire .  every set-piece is flawless , as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly , and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture .  wilder's script is stunning , as he carefully combines gangsters , cross-dressing , romance , sex , music , gender roles , and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness .  wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria , so pitch-perfect that the audience is dying of laughter with the last comic piece , the final line of this absolutely incredible film .  wilder's is dead wrong when he says nobody's perfect : billy wilder is , especially when he makes something this disastrously funny .  nobody's perfect but billy wilder .  
0 one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet's " gloria , " a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre .  suddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in .  when a movie is over , aren't we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ?  i thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn't have been anything to talk about in the first place .  to be sure , " gloria " begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy's family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it .  right before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with .  eventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment .  meanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn't commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime .  when he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude .  gloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don't they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with .  the previous incarnation of " gloria " by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can't really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars .  there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn't completely unbearable to watch .  i liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again .  these bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers .  throughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , " who really cares ? "  as gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn't sound realistic at all .  in the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone's performance was , but as the film progressed she got better .  although not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored .  jean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag .  all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria's friend whom she turns to for help .  sony , the studio that released " gloria , " obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don't blame them .  they declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved .  although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular " in dreams , " which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion " gloria " is going to vanish from theaters faster than " ishtar , " judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself .  although stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995's " casino " or 1996's " last dance " if you don't believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of " gloria " was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful .  
1 eight years after its release , disney has decided to re-release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only .  coincidentally , it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox's animated film anastasia was released .  you know disney , they can't deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old " masterpiece " from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox .  let no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market .  they still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place .  believe it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p . m . , i saw the little mermaid for the first time .  it took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom's friends for a couple weeks .  they had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times .  by the time i got back home , i promised myself i'd never see the movie .  but promises are made to be broken , especially when you're looking at a 17-day , limited engagement .  damn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games .  the little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it's disney-ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song .  it also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times .  i never wanted so much to be a pair of shells . . .  the heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16-year-old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase .  she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans .  she's also dealing with feelings she hasn't had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you didn't use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one ) .  her father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the " savage " humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not-so-subtle analogy about old- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating .  what's a king to do , though ?  the girl's in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn't deter her .  ariel saves the prince's life when a hurricane rises up , and just has to meet him .  she makes a deal with ursula , the sea witch ( voice of pat carroll ) .  you know she's evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history .  she also has octopus tentacles for feet ( something those dr . scholl's corn pads will not fix ) and offers to help ariel out .  she'll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever .  and if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she'll fall asleep forever .  it's a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company .  it ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the '50s .  all the elements are there -- memorable songs like " under the sea " and " kiss the girl , " cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children .  the little mermaid is worth a big-screen ticket in 1997 , so hurry up , you only have five days left .  serving america for more than 1/25th of a century !  
0 here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kong-recipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter .  these kinds of movies are marked by an eye-opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters ; a life-and-death plot in which these characters become involved ; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters ; ridiculous subplots , and sunglass-wearing henchmen .  that is not to say that i don't like hong kong influenced movies ; however , it is quite obvious that these moviemakers haven't a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip-hop-talking thugs and stupid sight gags .  observe the opening sequence .  a band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment , led by melvin ( mark wahlberg ) and cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) .  they are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles .  however , their partner is unsure of which cable to cut .  he is undecided .  this happens for about 10 seconds .  the audience finds some humor in his foolishness .  the lights suddenly go out .  cisco is surprised and says : " whoa . . . let's  go ! "  and they storm the apartment in a very nicely executed sequence .  the big hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film .  needing cash , cisco devises a plan to kidnap the daughter ( china chow ) of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi .  however , the daughter is also the god-daughter of paris ( avery brooks ) , who is cisco's and melvin's boss .  infuriated and insufferable , paris commands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping .  during his 'investigation' , cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader , and paris orders his capture and execution .  melvin must now find a way to stay alive .  by the way , do you know how the investigation takes place ?  cisco's partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing .  but , mr . nishi has a trace buster buster .  to counter that , cisco's partner has a trace buster buster buster .  but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster .  and so on . . .  there is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live .  and there are lots of issues that we'd like to know more about .  how does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee ?  what goes on among this clique ?  why is cisco at odds with melvin ?  there is actually a lot of potential material that could have been explored , but it seems that no effort is made to go in that direction , and instead we are given a not-so-engrossing plot filled with one-liners , silly sight gags , extraneous sub-plots and tomfoolery .  and , i haven't even mentioned his financee's visiting parents who want them to separate , nor melvin's mistress , nor the pimple-faced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on .  if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences , then shoot me now .  
1 oliver stone's latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents .  it's a three-hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century .  stone doesn't hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house .  the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done .  at the same time he creates a very human character , a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics , which is here pictured as a wild animal .  he is simply trying to tame it .  but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president's ability to control them .  stone doesn't in any way apologize for nixon .  he blames not only nixon's own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself , the system that , once set in motion , behaves with a mindlessness of its own .   " nixon " is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws .  there's something almost majestic about the process : as nixon goes down in this film , there is no gloating , but a watery sigh , as of a great ship sinking .  sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding , creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president .  joan allen's magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette .  she is strong and loyal as mrs . nixon .  the rest of the cast is equally magnificent , including : james woods , j . t . walsh , paul sorvino , ed harris and bob hoskins .  everyone does a serious and demanding job , no one are disappointing .  stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy , honest and determined .  he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element .  at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon's youth and childhood .  the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin , robert richardson's rich cinematography and john williams' musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere .  the film's only fault is that it's a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers .  still it's an honest and captivating - a solid piece of movie making .  
1 contact ( pg ) there's a moment late in robert zemeckis's contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place .  we see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops .  anticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead .  it is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment .  jodie foster stars as dr . ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals .  and i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie's world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth .  after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport .  from this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook .  the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power .  the irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right .  it would be easy for scripters james v . hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane .  in the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so--there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults .  the complex role of ellie is an actress's dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge .  she conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge .  we root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far .  contact is clearly foster's vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles .  matthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer-ellie romance , is the film's weakest subplot ) .  john hurt is effectively creepy as s . r .  hadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding .  angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine .  most memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr . david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances .  zemeckis comes off of his three-year break in top shape .  always known as a director of effects-laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact's visual effects are quite stunning .  the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis's voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick's yet more wondrously pure .  and zemeckis doesn't resist the urge to use the always-interesting incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump .  effects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump .  it says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it's not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised .  the thought-provoking , two-hour-plus contact is a much-welcome change of pace from summer no-brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn't entertaining .  for all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it's being sold as-- " a journey to the heart of the universe . "  and what a fascinating , unforgettable journey it is .  
0 starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role .  not that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation .  and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence .  sure .  william baldwin isn't a bad actor .  unfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie .  i'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good .  if it was the latter , it worked .  cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie .  which is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement .  although to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places .  so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ?  well , i'm glad you asked that question .  cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents .  why woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ?  by the end of the movie you won't care .  the story is so contrived it isn't funny .  anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin .  who's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) .  the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud .  the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes .  if i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears .  as for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability .  unfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad .  this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks .  it's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much .  unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you .  
1 i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files .  first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie .  the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable .  you have to reach for a larger audience .  therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly .  altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange .  but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on .  you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera .  in any case , the answer is no .  i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium .  however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie .  i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new .  everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others .  i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie .  warning : major spoilers follow !  please do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird " hummm " sound is all about .  you have been warned .  the x-files is what a summer should be .  exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances .  this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank .  from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you .  when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon .  this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes .  in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue .  you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd !  the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid .  you know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ?  so yeah , the x-files is scary .  and guess what ?  you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster .  do not think that the x-files is a monster movie .  in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total .  no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series .  scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time .  she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much .  no , this is mulder's time in the spotlight .  by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder " showers " independence day .  if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be " showering " godzilla instead .  to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who  cares ! ?  if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ?  the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous .  the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill .  the script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose .  if you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! !  unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects .  miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense .  also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don't !  the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation .  there is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ?   ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose .  who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a " big emotional scene " between godzilla attacks ?  so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose .  but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is .  what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ?  cool effects ?  it's good some .  pulse pounding ?  hell yes !  strangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time .  it does not provide answers to the show's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together .  rating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many " whoah , i never saw that one coming ! "  moments , four " holy shit , where the hell did that come from " and one heck of an ending .  you may wonder where this movie lost half a star .  well , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop .  it's pretty obvious the film's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving .  
1 more than forty years ago , the " sword and sandals " genre of historical epic ruled the box office .  during the 1950's hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope .   " ben-hur . "   " cleopatra . "   " the robe . "   " sparticus . "   " the fall of the roman empire . "   " quo vadis . "  sometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood .  since then , epics have appeared infrequently ( " the last emperor , " " braveheart " ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970's ( " roots , " " shogun " ) .  yet , the phrase " we who are about to die salute you " has been absent until now .   " gladiator " begins in germania in a . d . 180 .  roman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting .  however , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again .  when commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered .  maximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son .  a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa .   ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus' place is never explained . )  an african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus' wounds .  proximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena .  of course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads .  when commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete .  our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) .  the similarities to " braveheart " are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess .  also , like mel gibson's epic , " gladiator " has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero's anger .  it's a simple tale of good versus evil .  maximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family .  commodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience .  the opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate .   " gladiator " is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a " chick flick " be a " dick flick " ? ) .  there's much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences .   ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . )  lucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife .  joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance .  in the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father's love or pride .  throughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who's scripted as a caricature of evil .  i've been a russell crowe fan since " romper stomper . "  this role doesn't offer him the complexities of his parts in " l .  a . confidential " and " the insider " -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre .  the late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role .  i hope it will be rewarded with an oscar .  my only major quibble with " gladiator " is its stylized look .  several scenes are tinted .  we've seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in " payback " and " the matrix . "  i don't get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads .  in " payback " it was merely annoying , but in " gladiator " it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d'etre of the roman epic .   ( perhaps it's meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . )  also , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously .   ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . )  with a more realistic look , " gladiator " could be even more satisfying than " braveheart " because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion .  bottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices .  
0 my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies .  we are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills , the corny dialog , the ludicrous premises and the bad acting .  since other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment , we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together .  i can't remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along .  he was not amused .  i on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained .  perhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity .  i on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing : insulting my intelligence , and brought adequate movie-making skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made , at least in terms of the craft .  the movie could have been better if it were not so brusque .  this movie slaps you with conception , pregnancy , delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames , without pausing for infancy .  the producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a woman's womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm , and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an inside-out cesarean .  an autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone , to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect .  in a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp ; it is used only after the skull has been exposed .  the opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good .  the writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle : `as bad as it gets' .  as the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck .  eve ( natasha henstridge ) was cloned from sil , the original alien sexual predator , but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated , which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner .  in a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer ( marg helgenberger ) : `i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet . '  it's enough to melt the most callous heart .  at another point she protests : `i'm human too , you know . '  she is only half right .  peter medak , the director , knows his business .  justin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials .  james cromwell , his father , is perfect in a short role .  marg heldenberger , the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful .  natasha is an exquisite ornament .  george dzunza knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes things up .  michael madsen was there .  black buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits , which is more that we can say for lazard . .  
0 synopsis : al simmons , top-notch assasin with a guilty conscience , dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell .  making a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell's army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape .  sullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn's attention .  comments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the " spider-man " titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn .  mcfarlane's " spawn " immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s .  mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max .  the early " spawn " issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane's genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing .  with the popularity of " spawn " and the success of the current warner bros . 's batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn .  in the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series .  this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark .  what happened ?  why is spawn so bad ?  todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo .  i don't think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film .  i place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology .  these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc . spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics .  hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons .  a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don't get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren't engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath ) .  spawn's translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level .  mcfarlane's spawn was a tortured hero .  a mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda .  having died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda .  simmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married .  despite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn't help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld .  spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so .  when the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching .  the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters .  spawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman ) .  john leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second .  i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator .  the film , however , spends so much time on the violator's offensive antics that they grate on the nerves .  apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator's lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave .  leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film .  michael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on .  more time needed to be spent on white's character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings .  a special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn .  easily the hammiest performance in the movie , it's hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now .  sheen's excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film .  many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down .  mtv-style , jerky , in-your-face editing is one of them .  flames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting .  cogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film .  he goofily tells the audience , at one point , that " how much of [spawn's] humanity is left remains to be seen , " as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another .  the music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue .  loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes .  to be fair , however , marilyn manson's " long hard road out of hell " effectively compliments spawn's return to earth , while filter and the crystal method's " ( can't you ) trip like i do " proves a surprisingly fitting theme song .  for as good a comic book as it is , " spawn " did not spawn a good movie .  spawn , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little plot and character development .  it receives two stars for its technically well-done special effects .  many other films , though , have equal , if not superior , special effects and are much better .  rated pg-13 , spawn seems more violent than many r-rated movies and probably wouldn't be appropriate for the very young .  
0 i feel sorry for the financial backers of " waterworld , " which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made ( at $172 million ! ) , and is also one of the stupidest - boy did they get ripped off !  in fact , this film is not really a movie , but more of an amusement park ride with a plot .  it's not even just another case of cliches strung together ( well , it is that too ) , it's something that's painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws .  kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half man/half fish .  he is an explorer/mariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted .  he's referred to as the mariner , but they " the meaner " would have been a more appropriate title because he's cold , rigid , and strict - and he's supposed the be the good guy !  he docks at a small floating village of sorts .  he trades dirt for money and this introduces us to the other important characters .  first we meet one of the villains , then the soon-to-be heroine , a child prodigy , a wacky inventor , and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today , but also some of the low-tech tools used by pirates and vikings .  immediately the film's biggest flaw is apparent : are these people primitive or highly advanced ?  it doesn't seem like anyone can read yet they have ski-doos and airplanes !  how are these things powered ?  and if they have airplanes , couldn't they just keep flying until they reached dry land ?  also , if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things ?  i'm sorry , i'm all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies , but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us .  there was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology , so why mix the two together ?  it doesn't make any sense .  there really isn't much of a plot here because the story moves so quickly it never takes time to explain anything .  the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child , enola ( mojorino ) , has a tattoo on her back that is supposedly a map to " dryland . "  who put the tattoo there and how come it has taken them this long to figure this out ?  we never get an answer , just a stupid action movie about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryland .  to make a long , boring , stupid , and just plain bad story short ; the mariner escapes with a woman named helen ( tripplehorn ) and enola .  they sail for a long time , encountering some strange people in the process and fight off " the smokers " as lead by the idiot villain deacon ( hopper ) , who kidnaps enola .  the story becomes a overly grand adventure with the mariner taking on an army of goons , rescuing enola , and bringing them all to salvation ( how original ) .  even with all its special effects , action , and adventure this film is boring .  not a single character is likable , therefore neither is the plot .  dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholson's joker , while costner just plain rips .  still , " waterworld " is professionally made with a good production design and an original idea but no substance to it .  i just hope they don't make a sequel !  
0 this is the worst movie i've seen since the " so bad i walked out on it " " jingle all the way " .  it is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap .  it is crap through and through .  nothing works in this film , as to be expected from joel schumacher , who has made only one watchable film in his entire career ( that being " cousins " ) .  here's a man who admits he's a medicore director , a rather charmingly self-effacing statement .  but truth be told , he is much worse than mediocre .  not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though -- akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again .  there is no plot anywhere , and the " dialogue " is unrelentingly shallow , preposterous , and boring .  they set up mr . freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife , then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one-liners .  it turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death .  but that's par for course -- nothing in this film makes any sense , including half of arnold schwarzenegger's lines .  as mr . freeze , arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once .  this is the same problem he had in " jingle all the way " , and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass .  personally , i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn't retake scenes to make him understandable .  compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in " batman & robin " .  apparently , james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold .  uma thurman is not as bad , but nothing resembling good either .  her poison ivy vamps around terribly , chewing up scenery left and right .  and her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub-snl standard " acting " , as if she's reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment .  given the " script " , it's a wonder it didn't happen more frequently .  there is no redeeming feature in this film -- not george clooney as batman , chris o'donnell as robin , nor alicia silverstone as batgirl .  michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred , as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance .  in fact , there was something unsettling about his appearance , which seems to have been accomplished without any make-up tricks , looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man .  unfortunately , every scene about alfred's sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance -- they just go through the motions , losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart .  the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle -- you know there's a bunch of people , but instead of a melee , schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist .  there's never a moment of awe , wonder , or mayhem .  the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects , which are impressive ( and probably expensive ) .  even then , the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable .  the hockey team from hell ?  not even the tv series got that stupid ( at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that " batman & robin " showcases ) .  frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do .  blink , and you'll miss elle macpherson as julie madison , vivica fox as a " why is she even in the film " vamp in freeze's lair ( with all of two lines ) , and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had .  and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs , vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs . fries -- she isn't even filmed well enough to look good ( trust me , she's quite attractive outside of this dreck ) .  and as if the film weren't bad enough to limp along with bad direction , bad dialogue , bad performances , and bad fight scenes , there are inconsistencies and illogic galore .  i know it's nit-picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs , why the character's arms aren't ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a one-armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet ( while holding on to another person no less ) , or where the moisture comes from when freeze's weapon creates tons if ice .  that's all traditional comic book stuff .  but why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by-standers ?  why is there a big switch clearly marked , " heat " in mr . freeze's lair ?  why do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr . freeze hand to hand ?  why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her ?  why do batman & robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency ?  and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones , why don't they wear masks to filter it out ?  i could go on and on .   " batman & robin " is a braindead , pointless , garish , loud film that should still reign as the " worst film of the year " by the time 1998 rolls along .  note to warner bros . -- if you're going to make another batman film , please replace schumacher with nearly anyone .  because it could actually get worse than this .  what schumacher does not understand is that " comic book " doesn't automatically equal unbearable idiocy .  the true equation seems to be schumacher + batman = unbearable idiocy .  
1 in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well .  taken as a whole , there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us .  but it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted .  so , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it's a worthwhile sample of entertainment .  like scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man .  the formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different .  al pacino's slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams' sean mcguire is much more subtle .  and matt damon's will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o'donnell's charlie .  will is a troubled individual .  as a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse .  an orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis .  now , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet .  he has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box .  but he's a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems .  while working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building's hall blackboards .  then , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work .  will flees , but lambeau tracks him down .  unfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer .  the judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist .  eventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case .  after a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor .  and , as will advances his self-awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co-ed named skylar ( minnie driver ) .  the script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation .  the characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles .  at one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a " taster's choice moment . "  later , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith .   ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it's not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . )  director gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes .  there's an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric .  likewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie's friendship .  many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic .  matt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will .  minnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it's refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) .  the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber .  arguably the best dramatic work in the actor's career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination .  adequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) .  like most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable .  but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren't always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail .  good will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the " good " in the title .  
1 the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate .  people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future .  after a sort of confusing bit involving fake-looking cyborg things , the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds .  the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while ( make that every 1000 years or so ) an evil force comes to destroy earth .  the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element .  the plot in this movie really isn't that important to the thing though .  this movie has very good special effects , for the most part .  the techno-ish music in the background fits the mood very well .  bruce willis is an illegal taxi-cab driver in a futuristic new york city .  one day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk .  this movie is about what happens .  the plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations .  also there is a fair bit of action in the film , particularly towards the end .  some characters are just plain strange including a highly-energetic deejay in drag .  bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does .  the movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down .  it is one of those sci-fi films where you'll be saying " cool " followed by a " what the hell ? ! ? ! " .  i give the fifth element .  
1  " if there's a beast in men , it meets its match in women , too . "  starring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus  in recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy .  in modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals .  but in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge .  crows tear out the eyes of cinderella's sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version .  hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven .  writers have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots .  before this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years .  in the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan .  the story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose 'real' life we learn very little .  within the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen's grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways .  the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale .  i say " surprisingly " because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong .  and there are ways in which it does .  the performances are mediocre , except for lansbury's--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales .  the soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes .  probably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable .  but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness .  one of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the 'realism' of the screen .  part of me would love to see an adaptation of 'the lord of the rings , ' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker's recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind .  this makes jordan's accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery .  the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur-reality .  the sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant .  the nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly .  the peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary .  this archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you'd expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter .  for carter , the cauldron of story is a witches' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes .  she adeptly blends them all together .  there is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance .  the point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl's rites-of-passage on an unconscious , primordial level .  a night-journey through the forest , from the village to the grandmother's home , is the crux of the company of wolves .   " don't stray from the path , " rosaleen is told , again and again , and the path is both literal and figurative : the path through the forest and the path of life .  staying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen's elders .  carter and jordan , never conventional , explore what goes on when you leave the path .  those who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate .  this fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves , but the werewolves connote many things : death , sex , knowledge .  if straying from the path leads to death , then it's not a good idea--but if that's what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge ( and therefore power ) , then maybe it's worth the risk .  when you leave the path , the world becomes a dangerous , ambiguous place , but it's full of potential .  and it's certainly more interesting than the disney version .  
0 there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors .  when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture .  you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries .  i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories .  i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac's shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey .  the badness of patch adams is stupefying .  it's confounding .  i can't believe a film can be this bad .  and yet , it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make .  in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human .  in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn't want to kill himself .  while there , he notices that the doctors don't care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings .  so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients .  he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it's good to help people .  he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor .  naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams .  so patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have .  and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 .  on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter's performance , even if she is wasted ) .  but the film fails fundamentally in execution .  every scene swells with grand , " emotional " music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard .  take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus .  we don't know patch yet , but there's sad music , and it's supposed to make us really sad that he's sad .  later on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively .  and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad .  but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions .  real drama is character-based .  you grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it .  we don't ever grow to know the dying patient ; he's simply a vehicle for patch's greatness .  real drama doesn't seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry .  that's why patch adams is not real drama .  it goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene .  even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman's sickening musical score .  sentimentality like this is indeed bad .  but it's not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes .  you see , patch is a really great student .  he aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he's cheating .  but patch doesn't think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor .   " why don't we see patients until the third year ? " he bursts out every three seconds .  well , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients .  not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort .  most of us have to study .  and a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn't know a toe from a finger , probably won't be too successful in preventing death .  oh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to " prevent death , " but to " improve the quality of life ! "  yes !  that is true !  and you can not do that without studying .  you can not do that without going to medical school .  what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later .  follow the rules ?  bah !  who needs the rules !  only uptight doctors follow the rules .  the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants .  and then there's the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic .  a free clinic .  in the middle of the forest .  where patients can be taken to be helped .  for free .  how will patients be transported to the free clinic ?  will it have an emergency room ?  or is it just for mental patients ?  and who , may i ask , will pay for it ?  the film does give some token attempts to question patch's motives ( i think another character asks him how he's going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don't explore or challenge patch's ideas to any meaningful extent .  reader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams .  i know nothing about him .  if his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them .  but regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony .  and in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting .  actually , robin williams does a lot of shouting .  he shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words .  i won't tell you that you can't be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words .  i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be .  patch adams is the cheapest of them all .  
1 john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles .  so effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor's face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors ) .  example : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn't be more divergent--- i'll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go !  was a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn't see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation .  i muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity .  she responded with her usual query , " whose in that one ? "  this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see .  if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace .  anyway , when i answered " john cusack " , she replied with a rather stunned " who ? " , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to .  now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it's understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces .  i showed her a picture of cusack's mug in the paper hoping for an " oh - him , yes he's quite good " instead i got a " no - i don't know him " .  at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack's relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car .  cu-sack . cu-sack - no , not quite as cool .  i'm sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as " the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) " .  he's not a brand name , and his movies usually aren't big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he's kind of a genius .  with his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90's .  from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon .  despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he's a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen .  and he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin's and val kilmer's seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller ) .  high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it's a hit .  it was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank .  it's not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me .  high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his " top 5 break ups list " .  this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller's day off .  at first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack's witty delivery .  he's the kind of guy we don't mind talking directly to us .  gradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it's all very existential ) .  though that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films .  the best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy .  he's the kind of guy i'm sure we've all met before , a blowhard who thinks he's always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others .  but i like this guy , because of how black plays him .  the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes , but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak ( which might be a bit of a redundant description , seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic ) .  he's the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films .   ( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister ) .  but fears and black never let that happen .  the character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality .  he's over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to .  catherine zeta-jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own " charm " .  tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect .  the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation .  i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role , but instead of being likeable , she comes across as rather robotic , and as such it's hard to see why cusack's character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful , intelligent writer ( natasha gregson wagner ) potentially waiting in the wings .  this reminded me of say anything , where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye , and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood ( whose unbelievably more wooden then father , clint for those " special people " whose wheels turn a little slower ) .  in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his , though i'd bet that if laura and natasha switched roles , the result would be more effective .  high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances .  fears' direction is somewhat stilted , and the script is sometimes a little too ( and this is a word i'm beginning to hate to use but alas i must ) quirky for its own good ( i think i'll blame that on scott rosenberg , who judging from what he did with beautiful girls , con air , and things to do in denver while your dead , has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie ) .  but cusack really does deserve an award , for being so damn ? ? ? cusackian .  i'm afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent .  his character , rob ( whose sort of like an older , more bitter lloyd from say anything ) is funny and tragic without being pathetic , and that cusack can do all this , and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences , is something of an achievement .  
1 `run lola run' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance .  for a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non-stop movement , we follow a fiery-haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers .  lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer .  but , in something of a pseudo- `groundhog day' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal .  in these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola's journey , the future can be seriously altered .  `run lola run' is an experience like `fight club' or `the matrix' , in that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways .  in addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack .  `lola' is no exception , with stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get-go .  tykwer's world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola's fiery hair ) used as effective symbolism throughout .  with it's visual style and mind-blowing pace , `run lola run' is one of the more invigorating movies of the year .  even more so when considering the fact it's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time period .  as a heroine , potente does little more than run wildly through the streets ( as the title suggests ) , but she has a certain flair and charisma .  her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star .  meanwhile , bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life .  both actors perform beyond the call of duty .  the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola , and the outcome is ultimately rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected .  the other characters lola runs into ( both purposely and inadvertently ) include her banker father ( herbert kraup ) and a friendly security guard ( armin rohde ) , but aside from the two leads , no one has more than a few minutes of screen time .  additional stars that couldn't possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy , who are both responsible for the film's eye-catching visual elegance .  `run lola run' is subtitled , so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning-fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are especially fast .  this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching .  the other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation .  most are just chess pieces in tykwer's elaborate game of visual presentation , and he never really makes a significant move with any .  but , the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay .  a few petty gripes aside , this film is a wild , exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality .  most people believe foreign films are mainly boring , talky character studies .  perhaps `run lola run' will recharge their batteries .  not only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny , it also delivers a white-knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity .  like how the experience must have been for the persistent title character , `run lola run' is exhausting .  
1 note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often .  it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts .  the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other .  both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day .  however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary .  the setup for my best friend's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour .  the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan .  for example , there's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background .  my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one .  my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well .  in a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life , she'd actually like her too .  the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality .  throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion .  there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments .  my best friend's wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne .  this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable .  even better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend's weddding .  with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film .  she even sings - i won't soon forget her charming serenade of " i just don't know what to do with myself " .  rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film .  his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett's performance is a delight to watch ; he's clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous .  dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he's not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic .  when julia roberts' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as " america's sweetheart " by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile .  while that didn't quite work out , it's near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game .  my best friend's wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan's reputation as a skilled director of comedy .  
0 man , this was one wierd movie .  similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn't decide which genre it is .  the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone , which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship .  the last half hour ?  this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided - " screw it , let's just kill everybody " .  from then on - forget sci-fi . . . this  movie becomes 100% horror .  what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way .  instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare - this movie just uses loud noises , sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore . . . . . yawn . . . . everyone's  seen it all before and knows when to expect it .  the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew .  there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed , but what did this ?  then finally after being painfully restored - the new crew views the video .  the acting isn't too bad at all . . . . . considering what the actors had to work with anyway , as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of .  there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though , like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space .  this movie could have been so much better .  it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with .  there was just nothing new here that any of us haven't seen before in aliens or hellraiser .  
1 ingredients : pouring rain , small flooded town , damn about to burst , bad guys going after millions of dollars  synopsis : at one point in the story townsperson karen asks hero tom what happened to her church .  he replies something like : " the church is flooded but at least the floodwaters put out the big fire .  well , the fire wasn't that bad , since , while the church was burning , looters apparently thought it was safe enough to break through all the priceless stained glass windows . "  in hard rain a small town is nearly deserted due to flooding .  everyone has had to evacuate because it's raining , and now floodwaters are rising so high that buildings are being submerged and the nearby dam is about to break .  enter a working class smart-alecky new armored car driver named tom ( christian slater ) .  suddenly his security truck carrying over three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by armed looters .  tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money , hide it , and swim for his life .  this makes for an action movie full of jet skis , speedboat chases , and gun battles , as tom tries to evade and outsmart corrupt cops and armed looters until the national guard can answer his distress call .  he is befriended and aided by a spunky churchgoing young woman from town named karen ( minnie driver ) .  but unknown to tom and karen , the national guard never heard tom's initial distress call .  will tom and karen survive the natural and manmade disasters ?  opinion : don't expect thought-provoking issues or dramatics .  there's not much more to this movie than hiding , running , swimming , shooting , and saving handcuffed heroes from drowning , but that's what makes it escapist and fun .  relax , take your shoes off , and break out the popcorn .  
0 disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life , richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) sets off for thailand .  there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy ( robert carlyle ) who gives him a map to a beach , a secret utopia , then commits suicide .  richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel , ? tienne ( guillaume canet ) and fran ? oise ( virginie ledoyen ) .  once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach , there richard falls for fran ? oise .  this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element , which is solely a creation of hollywood , seems to hold to the original novel .  the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking .  i don't think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning .  but that is were many things go wrong , darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography .  though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking .  the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts .  this is where the movie has some great potential , then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better , yes folks i said better .  now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good , nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise .  this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un-watchable .  there is even a 'video game' style sequence that borders on the disgusting , it doesn't make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion ( and i am hoping many other peoples ) .  i am hoping that in my little rant i've made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing , so if you go see it and you don't like it because of this don't blame me .  the character development was not up to par either ; i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child .  although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard ( leo's character ) comes off as a wannabe philosopher .  the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason , granted some people are like this ( myself included ) but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does .  the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough .  richard is obviously obsessed by fran ? oise at the early stages of the story , yet there is actually very little development along this story line .  this i am sure contributes to the movie's lack of core plot and being unfocused .  now , i shall move onto something a little better about the movie ( for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it ) .  the cast and acting was passable at the very least , and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard .  mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better .  which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much ?   ( i think this is a topic all on its own so i won't get into it ) .  but i like the fact that there was an international cast used , had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible .  the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable .  not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense .  when all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable .  i would not recommend this movie to anyone , the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story .  as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt .  if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings .  
1 for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro .  if the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house .  that extra motive doesn't make happy gilmore a funnier movie .  it doesn't really add any genuine emotional depth , either .  in fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie .  but sandler's philosophy seems to be , if it's a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ?  that is endlessly refreshing .  in the wedding singer , sandler is right on track .  the fact that he's a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story .  what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important .  david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm .  he could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact .  but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character .  he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family .  robbie hart ( sandler ) doesn't just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing .  he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding .  the day comes when robbie has his own wedding , and he is stood up by his heavy-metal bride ( the movie is set in 1985 ) .  robbie takes it hard .  he doesn't sleep , he doesn't eat , and he gets punched out at work when he sings " love stinks " at a wedding .  julia ( drew barrymore ) , who waitresses all the weddings in town , gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to .  eventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia .  he really likes her , but she's engaged .  her fianc ? is a self-confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who doesn't deserve her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand .  julia seems to like robbie too , but she can't leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc ? for the off-chance that robbie might be serious about her .  you know the story .  you've seen it a million times before .  there's always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it's the same story .  and sometimes , it works .  the wedding singer works .  first of all , the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective .  actually , it's not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one's own romantic tension .  sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man , struck with an unattainable love .  barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with .  sparks don't fly when they kiss , but they both seem right for each other .  second , their love is mature .  they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction - they're a cute couple , but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material .  instead , they are both looking for someone meaningful , someone to settle down with , someone to grow old with .  at a wedding , robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by .  the repulsing situation is taken in stride , as if the two were already parents , caring for their sick child .  the ? 80s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie .  other critics liked this movie in part because of the '80s soundtrack .  i liked it in spite of the soundtrack .  often , the music and references felt forced .  for example , robbie tells his ex-fianc ? to " get out of my van halen t-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up . "   ( ha ha ha .  get it ?  david lee roth did leave van halen ! )  or how about when sammy ( allen covert ) , robbie's chauffeur friend , shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket and - get this - a single silver glove .   ( that's exactly what mj used to wear all the time ! ) .  unfortunately , making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding .  that's not to say the movie isn't funny .  screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before ( billy madison and happy gilmore ) , and the two make a good combination .  herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight-faced , smart-aleck style .  let's hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over .  with barrymore's charm and sandler's heart , it was hard to go wrong .  
1 originally entitled dancing about architecture ( i . e .   " talking about love is like dancing about architecture " ) , but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box-office dud dancing at lughnasa , this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names , playing interesting and well-written characters , within a vignettes-styled plot arrangement a la robert altman .  plot : follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love , finding themselves , regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are , and who they want , and appreciating the fine emotional art of love .  critique : charmingly effective romantic drama , this film offers insight into various types of relationships , presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast , and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties .  how do people fall in love ?  why do people fall out of love ?  how do people fall back into love , once they've been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club ?  all of these questions and more , are touched upon in this film , within several types of variant relationships .  meet a hip , young couple going through their first date .  a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships .  a married woman " finding herself " while cheating on her husband .  a husband letting go of his inhibitions .  an older couple dealing with a past " love " of the man , a secret recently uncovered .  a son dying from aids , joined by his mother at the hospital .  there are many nuances to this picture , and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate , but more importantly , there is diversity .  diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels .  some related to the younger couples' issues .  others with the married .  there's a little bit of everything for everyone in here .  and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year , i would relate myself to yet another predicament .  just like love itself , this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels .  the actors in this film are all also very , very good .  sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve , as is gena rowlands , as the aging wife with trepidations .  jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance , while philippe is as pretty-boy as ever .  anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re-ignite her love life , opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk-show host , jon stewart .  even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film , and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination .  the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached , was the part surrounding jay mohr , the man dying from aids , and his mother , ellen burstyn .  the actors were fine , but somehow , the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else .  the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me , but i guess that's just hollywood .  this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors ( 5 . 5/10 ) and happiness ( 4 . 5/10 ) in concept and style , but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness .  the characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care , as opposed to this film , which offers rich and believable characters , living real lives and talking about real issues in today's relationships .  all in all , this movie offers many interesting characters , talking and living genuine and engaging love lives , wonderful performances by its solid cast , too sweet of an ending , but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless .  little known facts about this film and its stars : according to a story in the london sunday mirror , sean connery asked for only $60 , 000 for his role in this movie , as compared to his usual fee of $14 million , because he liked the script so much .  on top of that , he convinced his co-stars ( including gena rowlands , gillian anderson , ellen burstyn , et al . ) to do the same .  this is director/writer willard carroll second real foray into the world of " adult films " .  before this , he had written and produced many children's movies .  gillian anderson stands 5'2 .  angelina jolie's full name is angelina jolie voight .  she is actor jon voight's daughter .  she has trained and performed at the lee strasberg theatre institute .  she divorced actor jonny lee miller of trainspotting ( 8 . 5/10 )  fame in 1997 .  they were married in 1995 .  actor ryan phillippe's full name is matthew ryan phillippe .  he stands 5'9 , and spent his childhood in new castle , delaware .  his acting career started on tv's " one life to live " .  he portrayed daytime television's first gay teenager .  jon stewart's full name is jonathan stewart leibowitz .  this film was originally entitled if they only knew and dancing about architecture .  watch for movie posters from swingers ( 8 . 5/10 ) ,  chasing amy ( 7/10 ) and the texas chainsaw massacre ( 8/10 ) at the movie theatre where the characters of joan and keenan go on their first date .  
0 i'm not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick , because i'm not sure just what the hell ( pardon the expression ) was going on in it .  however , i can express the most important observation i made of it , i . e .  i didn't like it .  if i had to summarize this film , i think i'd conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal .  that's the kernel of it , anyway .  tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women , feminism , the role of the devil , modern reformers , and friendship .  unfortunately , little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts ; they're simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace .  actually , i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was .  they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy , on the level of ghostbusters , and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones .  they laughed , or tried to laugh , at moments that were either barely funny , or much more horrible than funny , as if that could bend the film away from it's rather frightening direction .  three women ( cher , susan sarandon , and michelle pfieffer ) live in eastwick , a small midwestern town .  one night , while drinking late into the evening , they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives .  in seeming answer to their idle daydreams , a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be .  he soon shows evidence of mystical--perhaps demonic--power , and his devotion to the women's merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones .  even worse , when ignored his moods become ugly , and he mistreats the women for spurning him .  anyway , the problems : all three female characters are fairly uninteresting , and several are cardboard stereotypes , especially sarandon's character .  we never get inside them , never feel sympathetic to them , because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland .  as for nicholson , well , even the devil needs a direction to go in , and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie ( due to the grace of the screenwriter and , more importantly , nicholson's acting ) , he still can't be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague .  and then there's the special effects .  not in themselves--they weren't that good--but their overuse .  i was almost positive , until i saw the credits , that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind ( who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl ) , because of the big name actors in dopy stunts , or stephen spielberg , after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholson-blown-down-the-street stunt .  nope , it's another bunch of guys , and directed by george miller , who has shown great skill with stunts/special effects before ( the road warrior , " nightmare at 20 , 00 feet " episode of twilight zone : the movie ) but apparently doesn't know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act .  f'gawds sake , guys , this is jack nicholson !  let him loose !  let him grin demonically !  skip the splitting earth and fake lightning !  watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll , all i could think of was , " what a waste " .  if you're going to use slapstick like that , use it up on pee wee herman .  nicholson does what he can with the role , and when he can find his bearings , can be extremely good ( the scene in the church , for instance ) , but most of the time , he seems a bit stiff , as if he's not sure what he should be doing next .  and no wonder .  this script goes all over the map , giving you the feeling that it'd just love to be allegory , but it's not sure about what-- maybe if you give it time it'll think of something .  so what is the witches of eastwick ?  a horror movie ?  a folk tale ?  a comedy ?  a statement about women ?  an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality ?  i tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me . . . watching  someone regurgitate half-digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms , people , the screen , and ultimately , the audience .  in other words , a mess .   ( $2 . 00 )  if you like nicholson enough to watch him here ; maybe 25% of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others .  
0 it seemed like the perfect concept .  what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ?  it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh .  jim carrey's signed on too ?  even better .  the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as " schizophrenia , " and so forth .  such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy .  yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny .  it's not for lack of trying .  the farrellys utilize in " me , myself & irene " their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them .  this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult .  soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster .  this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street .  then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks .  some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work .  they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's " there's something about mary . "   ( 1999's " outside providence " was technically an earlier project . )  the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected .  in " mary , " the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion .   " me , myself & irene , " by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at " mary " and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work .  having been produced by the same guys who made " mary , " " irene " seems like an even bigger disappointment .  the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes .  but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of " me , myself & irene " comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy .  the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go .   ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ?  yeah , me too . )  the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be .  compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross .  the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry .  take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) .  the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face .  but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either .  that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through .   " me , myself & irene " reeks of wasted opportunities .  there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions .  this doesn't really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it .  the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , " whitey " ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax .  jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in " all of me . "  it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny .  carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way .  perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better .  zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead mary in " mary " may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed .  irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy , clever , or neither .  as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only " sane " person in the film .  chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this .  he , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected .  after viewing the shapeless mess that " me , myself & irene " eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves .  maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked .  but i don't believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style .  if the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they'll rebound just fine .  even after that happens , though , i'll still consider " me , myself & irene " to be a high-caliber misfire .  
0 play it to the bone is a punch-drunk mess of a movie .  containing a good cast but awful acting ; an interesting premise but terrible execution , ron shelton ( white men can't jump ) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two .  rocky no . 1 is vince boudreau ( woody harrelson , edtv ) , a bald , tattooed , newly converted christian , whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word . . .  something that he has not yet successfully achieved .  rocky no . 2 is caesar dominguez ( antonio banderas , the 13th warrior ) , best friend of vince who is currently dating vince's ex-girlfriend , grace .  both men are nearing the end of their " almost " careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity .  when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated , the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement .  our boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is " promised " a shot at a future title fight .  the film is divided into two sections .  at first , we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes , in grace's " sassy grassy " green muscle car , travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day .  along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by .  once in vegas , the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar .  both mr . harrelson and mr . banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past , not that we'd know it from their work here .  mr . harrelson is uncomfortably awkward , apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince .  the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable .  mr . banderas is uncharacteristically non-charismatic as caesar .  weak and ineffectual , there is little life in his screen performance .  the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another .  tom sizemore ( saving private ryan ) , robert wagner ( austin powers ii : the spy who shagged me ) , and richard masur ( fire down below ) are crooked promoters , lucy liu ( payback ) is a sex-starved hitchhiker looking for a good time , and lolita davidovich ( gods and monsters ) , is the shared girlfriend who can't make her mind up which boxer she prefers .  because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them , the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins .  but even then , because the outcome is so predictably obvious , the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other .  writer/director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed , well-choreographed , well-edited , and well-performed .  if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film .  as it is , the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable .  the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film .  the phrase , " play it to the bone' is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you've achieved your desired goal .  that is a biblical principle .   " know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ?  so run , that ye may obtain . "  1 corinthians 9 : 24 [kjv]  achieving anything worthy in life requires " playing it to the bone " .  we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives .  this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives .  as a movie , play it to the bone is hardly worth our time .  but as a principle of life , the phrase " play it to the bone " are words to live by .  
0 here's a concept -- jean-claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie .  now if that isn't enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie , i don't know what is .  all sarcasm aside , it is certainly a different way to start a movie , of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us , we get to see more of jean-claude .  van damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives .  van damme #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france .  the remaining twin ( the french cop ) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death .  once there , he hooks up with his deceased brother's girlfriend , played by natasha henstridge , and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are .  jean-claude's acting abilities don't seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie .  in other words , just in case you missed the sarcasm , his acting is worse than normal .  on the upside , natasha henstridge is in this film , and she does what she did best in species -- she gets naked .  sadly , this is probably the high point in the movie .  she is actually a decent actress , but didn't improve as much as i thought she would after species .  this is the typical van damme movie , with jean-claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents .  nothing new here , and certainly nothing we haven't seen in every other van damme movie .  simply put , there is absolutely nothing new about this movie .  it has a retread plot -- this isn't the first time jean-claude has played twins .  he still can't act .  we all saw natasha's breasts in species ( although this is one repeat performance i'm not complaining about ) .  this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in -- sub par .  
0 1989's " major league " was a delightful surprise .  i didn't expect much of it when i decided to watch it on cable , but it proved to be fresh and funny .  however , when the appeal of a movie is its freshness , the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale .  that's certainly true of " major league ii " and the most recent entry , " major league : back to the minors . "  the title is , of course , a contradiction .  shouldn't it be " minor league ? "  that contradiction suggests the lengths to which writer/director john warren has gone to squeeze a third movie out of the formula established by the first movie .  original stars charlie sheen and tom berenger ( who returned for " major league ii " ) are not around , leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the third movie .  the other veterans who return ( dennis haysbert as voodoo-inspired batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka , who was introduced in " league ii " ) seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise .  the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle , inexplicably broadcasting the games of a minor league team far from his home turf .  the protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell ( scott bakula ) , who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn ( bernsen ) to manage the twins' aaa team , the buzz .  you can write the movie from here : he finds a group of misfits who need to learn how to play together as a team in order to win .  there's a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing ( walton goggins ) , an ex-ballet dancer ( kenneth johnson ) , a broken-down old timer ( thom barry ) , twin outfielders both named juan ( the difilippo triplets ) , and a couple pitchers with throwing problems ( judson mills and peter mackenzie ) .  along the way , gus picks up cerrano and tanaka ( gus is supposedly an old teammate of theirs , even though he wasn't in either of the preceding films ) .  sum total : none .  the entire enterprise is artificial , and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors .  gus' antagonist is twins manager leonard huff ( ted mcginley ) .  leonard is a slimy , sniveling little egotist , and the twins are lazy , spoiled , and full of themselves .   ( even watching the first movie i wondered why any real-life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner ) .  gus challenges leonard to a match , the buzz vs . the twins .   ( wanna guess who wins ? )   " back to the minors " is a movie that has no reason to exist .  there's hardly a laugh in it , the cast is weak , and the first movie left no room for even one sequel .  
0 capsule : combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark , a dash of a jackie chan movie ( sans jackie ) , two teaspoons of gun- and swordplay , and a dollop of cgi .  simmer for 100 minutes .  yields : zilch .  the phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier , better movies that after the fifteen-minute mark i started cataloguing them out loud .  it's hard to make a good action-adventure movie that doesn't simply recycle its predecessors , and i've seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully .  the phantom , allegedly based on the long-running comic of the same name , doesn't even bother to be graceful .  it's a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list , but i'll try .  the film opens up with a " prelude " sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voice-over to compensate for whatever got thrown out .  we go from there to a jungle sequence that , i swear to god , recycles the truck-chase scene from raiders of the lost ark note-for-note , possibly even shot-for-shot , right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush -- and then goes on to rip off the rope-bridge scene from " sorcerer " as well !  sorcerer , as you may well remember , was a remake of a french movie , the wages of fear , in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain .  both versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick , but i've got my job to do , so back to the salt mines we go .  anyway , the cinematic theft doesn't stop there .  or at least the lack of inspiration .  there isn't a single thing here we haven't seen , and it's not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest .  we have ( where's my list ? )  a bad girl , a tough good girl , a secret cave hideaway ( which seems inspired more by dr .  no than anything else ) , a boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality , magical artifacts of terrible power , and cary-hiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache and sneer a lot and generally humiliate himself .  what else is there ?  the plot is a waste of time .  the sets alternate between big but hokey -- and tiny and still hokey .  there are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked -- and i'm sure once mike and the 'bots get the cash , they'll stick it on their sked .  the only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane -- he's a good actor , and he tries very hard , even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another .  all i can say is that i pray this isn't the beginning of the end for him -- although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comic-book super-hero movie .  
0 how could a g-rated disney film based on meg cabot's novel " the princess diaries " be anything but cute , harmless fun ?  easy .  take all the cute , harmless fun out of it .  and while you're at it make it borrr-ring .  that's what director garry marshall , screenwriter gina wendkos and , not to be outdone , producer whitney houston have done with the g-rated disney film " the princess diaries . "  you couldn't tell it from the audience though , a braintree , mass . of growing , glowing pre-pubescent girls ( and the odd parental , popcorn perched about their persons ) , who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ( ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddy-duddy old me ) .  well , i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over , but that would have been too obvious .  too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall's film ( garry made a couple of other " princess " movies-- " pretty woman " and " runaway bride " --but this one's way without julia roberts so maybe * that's * its problem ) .  in addition to being predictable as molasses , " the princess diaries " has hardly got a laugh in it ( it's a comedy ) , could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long , long stretches , and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we haven't even seen yet ( and probably never will except , perhaps , in the dvd edition ) .  marshall should take virtually all of the blame here , since he's been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two isn't working . . .  and hardly * any * of " the princess diaries " works ( " works , " alas , implies cleverness and there's none of that here either ) .  newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis , a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom ( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall ) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of ( the filmmakers go out of their way * not * to call it serbia , which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words ) and now she , mia , is next in line to rule " genovia " ( hence the headphones/tiara combo in the print ads ) .  julie andrews , with the luminous factor cranked to 11 , plays mia's grandmother ( aka queen clarisse renaldi ) , who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating , talking , and looking like a princess department ( although mia's big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan ) .  does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh ?  not really .  consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets .  also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock , an evil cheerleader , a dorky-looking best friend ( " welcome to the dollhouse " 's heather matarazzo ) , a sensitive auto mechanic/musician , and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver , imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mia's chauffeur-driven limousine at every intersection .  a non-animated g-rated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts , all the good stuff , has been exorcised from the finished product .  lame , labored , and lamentable , " the princess diaries " is recommended for eight-and-a-half year olds of the feminine persuasion * only * ; all others would do well to avoid it ( like potholes , the plague , and " the perfect storm " ) .  
1 the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year .  we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office .  this year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy .  i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them .  that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza .  in the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o'connell .  he teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra .  evelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable .  rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that's why she chose him to lead her there .  also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn's brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) .  now in hamunaptra , the three uncover " the book of the dead . "  the curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book .  along with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra .  not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt .  don't expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time .  this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers .  on the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that's up to you to decide .  there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though .  the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world .  we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human's skin .  these may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy .  as of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country .  in the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles .  when playing " george " in disney's george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone .  i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens .  in the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle .  although brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast .  weisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film .  the way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time .  evelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah's , didn't get much personal attention .  in many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part .  in the mummy though , not all of the mixing works .  there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work .  the mummy could have gotten an " a " rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these .  i didn't mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them .  the cinematography is amazing in the mummy .  particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians .  the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography .  from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch .  the bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start .  
0 i'm going to start this review off with a hypothetical question .  let's say you've just been in a car accident , and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious .  your friends have left to go get help , and you're waiting to see if the victim wakes up .  a tow-truck comes along , and the driver hops out of the truck to see what's going on .  he then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck .  do you :  a ) run away screaming for your life , staying away from the main road ,  b ) run away ( but not too fast ) and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you , * stop * to catch your breath , try to negotiate with the psycho , and when that fails , start running away again , all the while * staying on the main road * ?  if you answered " a " , you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of " texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation " and will likely hate this movie .  however , if you answered " b " , prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind !   " texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation " is being called a sequel , but it's really more of a remake of the original .  there's a few changes here and there , but it's essentially the same ( even the infamous " meathook " scene has been re-created . )  the story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom , and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere .  needless to say , they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family .  much carnage ensues .  to call this movie inept would be putting it mildly .  in addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question , there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere .  it just swoops down and kills him with its wheel .  no explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he/she is going around killing people with the planes wheel .  the dialogue is even more atrocious .  zellwegger , who is kidnapped by " the family " early on , keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people .  when you're surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses , i would think that rationality would go out the window .  speaking of going out the window , there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window .  apparently , the stunt double had a little trouble , because she visibly gets stuck in the window .  the director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double * doesn't * get caught in the window .  this was one of many glaring inconsistencies .  there are so many , in fact , that if i were to name them all , this review would be several pages long .  the only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey .  he plays a member of " the family " with a hydraulic leg ( home-made , i might add ) and is so completely over-the-top , you can't help but be amazed by his performance .  he obviously had a lot of fun with this part , and it really shows .  he makes jack nicholson's portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in " the shining " look restrained in comparison .  for a horror movie , " texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation " contains surprisingly little gore .  in fact , in contains none .  there's a little blood here and there , but that's as far as it goes .  which leads me to believe that the budget must have been * astonishingly * low , and it shows .  everything about the movie looks cheap , from the sets to the costumes .  especially leatherface .  once frightening and nightmare inducing , he's now as terrifying as dame edna .  do yourself a favor and take a pass at this remake .  check out the far superior original instead .  
1 sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist  by fernando vallejo  starring bob flanagan and sheree rose .  interviews by kathe burkhart , kirby dick and rita valencia .  produced and directed by kirby dick .  running time : 90 mins .  this film is not rated .  the central themes of " sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist " are pain and love , and its subsequent effect on a person's life .  its protagonist , bob flanagan , who died at the age of 52 , suffered from cystic fibrosis , a mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus , preventing him from normal breathing .  the movie is about much more than recouperating ( or attempting to ) from this disease .  an audacious , fabulously triumphant docudrama , " sick " chronicles the life of flanagan and his vicious , unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of 15 years , sheree rose , who amazingly provided much of the footage for the film .  flanagan's idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness and becomes transcendental , similar to terry zwigoff's brilliant 1994 " crumb " , which also explored the dysfunction of an artist by painting not a sympathetic portrait , but a realistic one .  both crumb and flanagan revelled in their defects .  but flanagan was not only a man content on enduring the pain via lungs , he inflicted acts of pain on himself at a very young age , courageously defying god ( he was an irish catholic ) and turning his body into a work of art , which he unraveled in museums and lectures .  behold these works of physical art .  among them is a metal ball inserted inside his anus , and , --the most disturbing scene of the decade-- , nailing his penis to a board .  flanagan was a man of great intelligence , wit and humor , as well as adopting a sense of candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking .  not only did he approach his disease with humor , peforming burlesque acts in front of an audience , he was also revitalized by his approachment .  most with cystic fibrosis do not make it past their earlier twenties ( there's also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death was awaiting her .   )  but the most outstanding thing about " sick " is flanagan's relationship with sheree .  brimming with honesty , sensual stimulation and unapologetically sad moments of pain , their powerful bond lifts " sick " into a rare cinematic high , where we forget we are in an auditorium and become a part of these people .  the last scene , where we see the hero murmuring the last words to his wife in a hospital bed , as he struggles for his last moments of life , is raw , tender , hideous .  it goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy .  
0 the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , " i think we need a bigger bat cave , " or something to that note .  that's exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much .  cut batgirl out .  cut one of the villains .  it's too much to handle in one dosage .  it's so much that characters get left behind .  poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form .  and elle deserves better .  this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher .  it's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel ) .  the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel ) .  this one's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck .  it's up to joel to make it fun though .   " batman forever " was fun .  this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters .  i mean , this one bit .  i'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr . freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days .  he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ?  joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body .  batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart .  meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had .  she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people .  she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo .  meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr . freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl .  meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing .  end of her for all we know .  mr . freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! ) .  the trio must team together " as family " to beat them .  there ya go .  not the whole story but no big context clues .  too much , right ?  right !  the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels .  however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one .  he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it .  maybe some stunts .  for all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy !  and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say .  i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode .  george is in between them .  he's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good .  but i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) .  the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher .  last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey .  this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze .  we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ?  arnold isn't very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points .  when he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber .  wow .  but uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness .  it's like she's almost parodying herself in " pulp fiction " at points .  she's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better .  as for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in " batman forever , " although i think his work in these is too hokey when he's best at quieter parts in " scent of a woman " or just plain cool parts in " fried green tomotoes . "  alicia - i love the girl but she's not particularly good in this film .  she can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in " clueless , " but her lines kinda sound weird .  and it isn't the mushy-mouth this time .  but in all fairness , she has virtually no part .  joel gets around to her occasionally and when she's on , she does stupid stuff . . . although  i know i'm not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma . . .  and poor elle .  poor , poor elle .  i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw " sirens " ) .  but she has no part ! ! !  it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product .  there are no " couch " scenes ( like my best friend noticed ) .  now listen to me on this one - in every " batman " flick , there's a couch scene .  in the original , it was with vicki .  in " returns , " it was a good make-out scene with selena .  and in the last one , it was a chat with nicole .  this one , it's nothing .  and batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she's suddenly " part of the family . "  fortunately , we get a lot of alfred .  he's the always reliable butler , in case you didn't know , who has been with bruce all his life .  he's a god .  he's a father figure .  he's also dying .  this got to me .  i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me .  we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time . . . but  this is never answered , as this film is too cluttered .  but in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma .  for one , george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do .  and there are some nice touches .  when they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient's belongings in a room and we see the riddler's costume .  i laughed .  and during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as " droogs " from " a clockwork orange . "  i laughed at all these .  the film falls apart around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . . . or  did it just feel like that ?  the film should serve as another in the long-line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays .  people are fed up with stupid films .  that's why the word of mouth killed " the lost world ! "  that's why last year , indy films grossed more than ever .  that's why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it .  that's why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo's " face/off " and barry sonnenfeld's " men in black , " both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on .  i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste .  i like some of his films ( " flatliners , " " a time to kill " ) but a lot of them suck .  he's a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that's what makes him great .  but his costuming for woody allen's " sleeper " was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) .  i love the " batman " series .  the first two rocked and i did like the last one .  but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three .  hopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time .  and maybe they'll get smart and bring back catwoman .  and michael keaton .  but we can only hope .  
0 robin williams , this time without a beard , returns to drama in this sloppy , sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects .  he plays chris nielsen , who meets annie ( annabella sciora ) and promptly marries her .  they have two great kids , who sadly die in a car crash .  just when it couldn't get any worse , chris gets killed in a car crash , and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert ( gooding jnr . )  annie can't take the grief anymore , and kills herself .   ( all sounding like good fun so far ? )  the 'penalty' for suicide is to go to hell , and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller ( max von sydow . )  based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson , what dreams may come is clunky , manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar .  this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made .  everything is wrong about this movie : the performances are forced , and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters .  williams puts on a convincing upset face , but that's all it is : a face .  there's no emotion behind it .  sciora's performance is lazy , and bogs down the whole film .  she may look pretty , but she can't act .  max von sydow is o . k as the traveller , if nothing special .  cuba gooding jnr , thankfully , adds some bounce to his performance , and is certainly the best performer in the film .  it's a shame that his character is so flat and 2-d , and offers no room for improvement .  all the performers have to work with a soppy script , that tries it's best to get some emotion going , but never takes off the ground .  there are _some_ scenes which could be real heartwarmers , but the faceless characters don't help to get anything out of the performers .  while films like e . t used great actors , music and direction to pull of a masterful heart-tugging scene , what dreams may come is haphazard , expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically .  instead , it's all rather boring .  sure , the music is pretty ( by michael kamen ) and the cinematography isn't bad ( by eduardo serra ) but there's something lacking .  the script doesn't help , filled with hopeless romantic clich ? s , and dud speeches .  richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories , sadly this novel would look embarrassed in a bargain bin , let alone being converted into a $70 million vehicle for robin williams .  despite being set in heaven , what dreams may come is mightily depressing .  the film rushes a happy ending , but everything before this is very , very sad and black , which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid .  but there's one redeeming feature about this failure of a movie : the special effects .  heaven and hell are truly incredible places , and the actors fit perfectly with the virtual sets .  but despite this , what dreams may come , proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment of 1998 .  instead of raising questions about existence , it raises boredom .  sadly , i recommend you give this film a miss .  better luck next time , robin .  a david wilcock review ? 1998   " you know , for kids " - norville barnes  
0 tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie .  the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster .  enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious .  the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium .  tectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences .  it's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , " look !  art ! " ) ,  although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters .  because we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a movie , it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas .  they're not real , sympathetic , or believable .  i'm willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success .  tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) .  one day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself .  while preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision .  meanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host .  with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else .  however , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers .  the tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn't take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious .  tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point .  there are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren't bilingual ) .  the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it's different , ( b ) it's not like anything they've seen before , and ( c ) it's pretentious .  for everyone else , it's not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage .  
0 it should have been a classic .  a great cast of respected supporting actors .  an interesting premise of loser comic book characters .  however , " mystery men " proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999 .  the jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals .  the number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise .  the script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh-out-loud joke and mediocre small jokes , it failed miserably at being entertaining at all .  the jokes were not funny for a number of reasons .  they had been used a number of times before in previous films , the best ones , which were mediocre to begin with , were ruined in the trailer , and the expectation of laughing at clever , unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film .   " mystery men " might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business .  but with veterans doing this kind of junk , it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought .  thankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie .  the film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy .  the fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero , captain amazing , who has recently captured every evil-doer in the city .  captain amazing ( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear ) , because of his success in the past , is worried that he will lose popularity .  after freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city ( geoffrey rush , overacting just a bit too much ) to keep himself busy , things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured .  it is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day .  by the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven't already figured it out ) is very low .  there are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention .  the first scene in the film , which shows the wannabes trying to save the day , feels like it was seriously edited down .  right when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk's home by some masked goons , captain amazing comes in and saves the day ? or ruins the movie .  instead of editing this scene , more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and monica , a waitress ( claire forlani ) or the vast majority of the film , which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was .  a simple rule : more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work .  another major problem with " mystery men " is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances .  the film depended on its cast to work fluently together , like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion .  however , most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way .  to pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat , paul reubens , who disappeared from acting to everyone's joy , returns here leaving very little to be impressed about .  as a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon , all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes .  fart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of " american pie " and " there's something about mary . "   " mystery men " drags on towards the end to a point where anything else in the world is more entertaining .  anyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in a helpful way .  so why continue to watch ?  this film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure .   " mystery men " indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says " i knew you could do it ! "   " mystery men " fails in every category it attempts to pass .  what makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable .  terrible acting , terrible script , and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors .   " i'm unpredictable ! "  an overexcited ben stiller shouts out .  no ben , you're the complete opposite .  
0 darren ( jason biggs ) , wayne ( steve zahn ) , and j . d . ( jack black ) have been best friends since the fifth grade .  like the three musketeers , they've been together through thick and thin .  but , when darren meets an attractive , but cold-blooded and manipulative , psychiatrist , judith ( amanda peet ) , the long time friendship is placed in danger .  it's up to wayne and j . d . to rescue their best friend in " saving silverman . "   " silverman " has its heart in the right place , but the story , by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul , is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren's soul .  based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake , the story is centered on the three , life long amigos .  when wayne introduces darren to judith , he doesn't realize that he has opened a pandora's box of disaster for himself and j . d . judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match .  since then , she has sought a new mate - someone she can boss around and mold into her own vision .  enter darren silverman .  once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement , wayne and j . d . try everything they can , including threats and bribery , to get judith to free darren .  nothing works until the duo come up with a plan - kidnap judith and get darren back together with the girl he called his one and only , pretty sandy perkus ( amanda detmer ) .  the only problem here is that sandy is about to take her vows to become a nun .  things spiral out of control as judith repeatedly attempts to escape while wayne and j . d . play cupid .  the boys even bring their idol , neil diamond , into the picture to help resolve things .  thinking about it , this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black .  the pair is able to elicit the film's only laughs with their goofy antics and child-like behavior .  they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task .  steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne , the " brains " of the gang .  jack black has the big-guy moves of a chris farley , giving j . d . an amusing physical presence .  the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material .  the rest of the cast doesn't fare as well , though .  jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do ; though having watched his previous films ( " american pie " and " loser " ) i'm not sure what attraction biggs actually has .  amanda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith .  there is no humanity at all to her character as she single-mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind's image .  she's a monster that wayne and j . d . must defeat to save their friend .  unfortunately , there is no dimension to her character .  amanda detmer brings nothing ( or gets nothing ) as darren's one and only .  r . lee ermey , as the psychotic coach , made a bad decision taking this role .  tune-meister neil diamond gives a good-natured cameo perf as the boys' idol and savior .  production values are on par with the rest of the film - lackluster and non-involving .  director dennis dugan has a track record for broad comedy with films like " big daddy " and " beverly hills ninja , " but falls flat with " saving silverman . "  the 2001 movie year has yet to provide us with a " good " film to sink our teeth into .  at least , with " saving silverman , " we get a couple of funny perfs from zahn and black .  too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor .  kick boxing deaths and conflicted nuns are not the makings of a good comedy .  i give it a c- .  
0 the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film's end .  if you're not familiar with this law , then maybe you've seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film's end .  now if you're a regular reader of mine , you've heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end , but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ?  no , it definitely is not .  melissa joan hart ( from abc's " sabrina , the teenage witch " ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team .  adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who's just broken up with his activist girlfriend .  apparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take him back , and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance .  so the two pretend to date for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud .  will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ?  will this crazy scheme work ?  do i care ?  the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy .  what makes movies like can't hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she's all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly .  i don't know what the writer's intention was with drive me crazy .  there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to .  here there's nothing . . .  just teens whining about who's going to take them to the big dance .  do me a favor kids , go get a job or something . . .  just shut the hell up .  in all honesty , the best part of this film is the end credits .  now normally when i say that it's followed with the joke " . . . because the movie is finally over . "  in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film .  after the obligatory second playing of britney spears' titular song , there's a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school .  nothing great , but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them .  sci-fi fans take note : there are brief appearances from stephen collins ( star trek : the motion picture ) and faye grant ( the tv miniseries " v " and " v : the final battle " ) .

1 `we run tings .  tings don't run we . '  -sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) .  jamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) .  capone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him .  when he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) .  capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him .  torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again .  directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while .  shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are .  the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) .  the make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team .  the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest .  paul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times .  mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together .  unfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed .  the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) .  the end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review .  oddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us .  at the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) .  palm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters .  chris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record .  overall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong .  if action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film .  the performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight .  i'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved .  
1 in december of 1996 , a little movie called " scream , " was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens .  first , it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad ( both " scream " movies , " i know what you did last summer , " " urban legend , " etc . ) , but just recently , the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre ( a 'la '80s john hughes ) , starting with last june's " can't hardly wait . "  it may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single week : " varsity blues , " " jawbreaker , " " cruel intentions , " " simply irresistible , " " the rage : carrie 2 , " and " the mod squad . "  coming april 9 are two more of this type : " never been kissed " and " go , " and on april 23 , we've got the teen satire " election " and the teen horror-comedy " idle hands . "  jeesh !  out of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , " 10 things i hate about you , " is this past january's mediocre , ho-hum " she's all that . "  although similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , " 10 things i hate about you , " a modern-day version of shakespeare's " the taming of the shrew " ( " she's all that " got its inspiration from " pygmalion " ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985's " the breakfast club . "  and to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn't have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in " she's all that ? " ) .  the day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) .  although he doesn't know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won't allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to .  kat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) .  complicating matters , cameron's dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey .  as you can see , " 10 things i hate about you " includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven't even mentioned , such as kat's shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca's materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) .  at a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of " she's all that , " where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , " you're vapor " ) .  since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained .  aside from a good screenplay , it's the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot .  aside from joseph gordon-levitt ( " 3rd rock from the sun " ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings .  as the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries " the '60s " ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her .  even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat's way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality .  no one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does .  heath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles .  one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set .  in one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has .  one off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school's staff act , which is strikingly unformal .  allison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl " chill " mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good .  although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters .  in one very funny scene , chastity asks , " i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? "  at another point , bianca and kat's father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it's like to be pregnant .   " 10 things i hate about you " once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the '90s .  it also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave '80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) .  by the film's end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) .  luckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about " 10 things i hate about you , " but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten .  
1 carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion .  made in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre .  sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode .  the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard .  this time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode .  the doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - " i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! "  bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself .  there are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he's at work ( at the railway station ) .  sid james' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home .  he has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him !  the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital's pills with panic ensuing .  there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous 'matron's' .  williams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn't given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all .  the same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time , he seems to steal every scene he is in .  by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor's talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters .  this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored !  
0 new address .  same old attitude .  don't forget to recommend a film , read the journal , or send me some of that nasty hate mail . )  starring bruce willis , billy bob thornton , liv tyler , ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh and j . j .  abrams directed by michael bay  it rocks-actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film .  they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like .   ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur . )  they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user's answer to deep impact .  bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond " zero barrier " and destroys our planet .  why an oil driller ?  they require someone experienced with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid .   ( in one unintentionally ( ? )  hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his own blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it .  we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids ? )  harry assembles the obligatory " ragtag " bunch of " cowboys " , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) .  once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes .  whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal .  nor will you care .  i will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope .  willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck .  their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material .  steve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic .   " rockhound " , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film .  so why did they bring him up there to begin with ?  rather , why write him into the film ? -give  his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig .  i'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue .  liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( " aerosmith " ) songs grace the soundtrack .  director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen .   ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain . )  whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out " we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) ! "  i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood .  armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla .  it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework .  it has a vivid soundmix .  but at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story .  the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever .  bollocks !  the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler .  remember a little film called jaws ?  in this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark .  they didn't much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another .  one of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories .  this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end .  not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i'd be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before " action " was called .  a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery .  to this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn't build a birdhouse .  and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life .  
0 toward the bottom of the '80s action movie barrel lies action jackson , the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within a span of ten minutes .  this carl " apollo creed " weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs . evil establishment crook , and relies on all the '80s trappings , from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer .  somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs , although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs .  weathers is action jackson , a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques .  speaking of one past criminal apprehension , jackson's superior yells , " you tore his arm off ! "  jackson replies , " he had a spare . "  jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane ( craig t . nelson ) and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson .  after hearing what jackson thinks of him , stone says , " i take it you're not one of dellaplane's friends . "   " not unless they changed the definition , " jackson glowers .  and of course it turns out stone is mrs . dellaplane .  faux pas , jackson . . .  not everything is happy in motown ; people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa .  it's all up to jackson to stop it , and his only lead lies in vanity ( not his own ) .  wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson .  she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplane's nightclub .  after singing one particularly sultry number for him , she saunters over and complains , " i expected a standing ovation . "  he responds , " you're getting one , " and it's damn clever because he's sitting down at the time .  prince wouldn't even let out an innuendo that lame and he's the king of the horndogs . . .  or at least the prince .  it's a testament to the '80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes but vanity survives the whole movie .  action jackson is another variation on the " unlikely partners " buddy action flick , with jackson lugging junkie vanity around .  this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade , and with the dialogue they're given , there's not much room for improvement .  my favorite is when vanity , feeling the effects of drug withdrawal , says , " i feel like my teeth are hollow , my gums are made of dry rubber and someone's trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head . "  jackson's response is , " i think i felt that way once .  they called it love . "  you'll understand when i say watch this at your own risk .  serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century !  
0 the best thing -- in fact , the only good thing -- i can say about dark city is that it made me want to go see l . a . confidential again .  or go rent body heat , to see william hurt do some real noir .  or even -- god help me -- palmetto .  alex proyas's new movie screams atmosphere .  i screamed , too , " get me out of this theater ! "  new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors , and doesn't have any way to get it back .  i paid $4 . 25 for a matinee screening and don't have any way to get my money back , either .  you'll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie .  i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning , nightmarish future world where it's always a late night in 1948 , complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras .  i've got news for you fellows -- i don't care how hard you worked , or how visually stunning this movie looks -- you wasted your time and mine , working on a movie without a plot , without a clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go , without a soul or a reason to care .  the movie starts out oh-so-promising .  john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life , would have been boarded up long ago .  there is a dead , mutilated prostitute in the other room -- a surprise , as he has lost his memory .  the phone rings : it's a sinister-sounding man , claiming to be his doctor , telling him to flee for his life .  all well and good , right ?  wrong .  apparently , someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot .   ( this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood . )  so , the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life , rather , it's a voice-over narration by the aforementioned doctor ( keifer sutherland ) explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible .  it's as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca .  no , wait , that's not fair to casablanca .  it's more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show -- or if you want to know how i really feel , having an off-screen narrator explain that gilligan won't be getting off the island in this episode .  >from here , the coherence of the plot goes down faster than ( insert monica lewinsky joke here ) .  the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason , and that's what moves the plot .  what we're left with is a string of unanswered questions that don't make any sense .  we're given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers , yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed .  we're given a hero who can " tune " into these same powers , yet he only uses them when it's convenient to the plot .  we're given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere  usually , critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part " isn't given much to do . "  in this movie , no one is given anything to do .  sewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesn't remember anything , and plays it like . . .  um . . .  a man who doesn't remember anything .  the aliens are tall , pasty-faced , and bald , and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they're evil -- and there's a child alien as well , straight out of an anne rice novel .  sutherland is saddled with a limp , a twitchy eye , and a breathy accent to remind us that he's in league with the aliens .  to its credit , dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting .  william hurt is perfectly cast as the world-weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city .  jennifer connelly , playing sewell's love interest , is given two all-too-brief moments on screen as a lounge singer -- and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit .  but instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script ( the way they would be in any self-respecting noir movie ) they're almost tangiential to the plot , such as it is .  the problem with dark city is this : it's a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir .  the essence of film noir isn't , as proyas seems to beleive , breathy dialogue or snap-brim fedoras or tall , bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner .  dark city has not one bit of intrigue , moral ambiguity , suspense , or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics .  dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic .  it's an exceptionlly well-made and intricately designed piece of flotsam , sailing around and around the middle of the ocean , going nowhere .  
1 i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files .  first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie .  the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable .  you have to reach for a larger audience .  therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly .  altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange .  but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on .  you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera .  in any case , the answer is no .  i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium .  however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie .  i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new .  everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others .  i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie .  warning : major spoilers follow !  please do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird " hummm " sound is all about .  you have been warned .  the x-files is what a summer should be .  exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances .  this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank .  from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you .  when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon .  this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes .  in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue .  you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd !  the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid .  you know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ?  so yeah , the x-files is scary .  and guess what ?  you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster .  do not think that the x-files is a monster movie .  in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total .  no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series .  scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time .  she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much .  no , this is mulder's time in the spotlight .  by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder " showers " independence day .  if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be " showering " godzilla instead .  to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who  cares ! ?  if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ?  the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous .  the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill .  the script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose .  if you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! !  unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects .  miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense .  also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don't !  the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation .  there is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ?   ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose .  who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a " big emotional scene " between godzilla attacks ?  so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose .  but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is .  what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ?  cool effects ?  it's got some .  pulse pounding ?  hell yes !  strangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time .  it does not provide answers to the show's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together .  rating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many " whoah , i never saw that one coming ! "  moments , four " holy shit , where the hell did that come from " and one heck of an ending .  you may wonder where this movie lost half a star .  well , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop .  it's pretty obvious the film's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving .  
1 most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy .  rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category , but manages to be slightly unique .  the rocky formula of " rocky loses fight/rocky trains/rocky wins fight " is carried out to the letter .  also the 'tradition' of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well .  this movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky ( sylvester stallone ) has become . . .  even showing a brief appearance on sesame street ! !  then it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips ( hulk hogan ) .  a mysterious bad-ass known as clubber lang ( mr . t ) trash-talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he " pities the fool " for not coming out and fighting him outright .  rocky's trainer ( burgess meredith ) tells rocky not to fight , but the italian stallion doesn't listen .  naturally , he gets his ass kicked .  somewhere along the line after this several things happen .  rocky's longtime trainer dies , causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed .  rocky's wife complains to her husband that he should fight .  the final fight ensues between clubber and rocky .  guess who wins ?  the winner's name rhymes with 'smocky' .  the movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber lang's over the top performance .  the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film .  which is good if you like fighting scenes .  the last match is quite decent actually .  if you liked the previous films , rent this one .  it's well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series .  but if you can't stand rocky shouting " adrianne ! ! ! "  one more time , see something else .  
0 my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free .  as lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book .   ( " without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . " )  languidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending .  since it's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery .  other than a few nice visuals , there's nothing to recommend the picture .  with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he's more than the world's best oscar host .  he does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year's father's day and this year's my giant .  one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project .  surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there .  perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success .  or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie's somber tone .  the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day .  this one-joke movie's single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible .  sammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) .  after throwing out constant one-liners ( " either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car . " ) ,  sammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket .  and although he doesn't like it , he's willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs .   ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . )  after a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie .  we learn that max's condition is terminal , and he will soon die .  to be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers .  let's hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie .  my giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 .  it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up .  my son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it .  matthew pointed out that it " is not as good as it could have been or should have been . "   ( amen . )  he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle .  jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was .  
0 watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey .  if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star .  alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs .  what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars .  that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek .  when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it .  so why such a seemingly high rating ?  there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage .  first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater .  the sound and screen kicked ass .  nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) .  also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension .  i even liked the computer-generated settings .  i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities .  also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain .  william hurt isn't too bad either .  neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable .  and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood .  there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a " real " kiss -- no sex ) .  it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six .  those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven .  that type of moviemaking is a lost art .  now for the bad news .  worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue .  it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction .   " you better hold on to your joystick , " is one such line .  and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign .  second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay .  the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest .  once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived .  when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : " he flipped the switch to 'evil . ' "  then there's the tone of the movie .  the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson .  then it could be an adventure movie .  they're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off .  still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination .  just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a " promise keepers " notion of who's the center of a family .  many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect .  and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie .  in star wars , the rebels were the good guys .  we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system .  in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free .  that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists .  finally , a few specific details deserve criticism .  the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 .  why ?  why bother saying what year this is .  just tell us it's the future .  i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 .  setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) .  then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole .  this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics .  one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool .  the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip .  this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie .  but if that's the best part of the movie , i can't in good conscience recommend it .  still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your " bad movie bingo " cards .  
1 uncompromising french director robert bresson's " lancelot of the lake " achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory's " morte darthur . "  instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them .  chivalry has no place in " lancelot of the lake , " except as that of a dying ideal .  bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin's command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ's blood .  bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure .  the opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house .  since the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn't carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films .  we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness .  but , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film .  rather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom .  lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh .  the greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur's wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot .  even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment .  he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion .  when sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot's defense .  it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire .  bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men's hearts and minds .   " lancelot of the lake " is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music .  he uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits .  the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film's thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest .  like most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices .  all the actors he used in " lancelot of the lake " had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again .  never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word .  instead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images .  in some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it doesn't .  the final montage of arthur's men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment .  however , other times bresson's uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable .  for instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses' legs .  he does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag .  while there might be symbolic value in this , the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome .  nevertheless , " lancelot of the lake " is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker .  bresson's style may not be for everyone , but one has to respect his strength as an artist .  by re-evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own , he turns " lancelot of the lake " into something rare in modern cinema : a truly personal film .  
1 john carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has it's good side and it's bad .  it's held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending that's pretty satisfying .  james woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie .  the good side : some neat scenes of vampires and violence .  the bad : no scares .  yes that's right , even though being directed by one of horror's most cherished directors , 'vampires' is the least bit scary , if not at all .  james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the 'master' vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight .  daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya , a wise-cracking guy who really isn't that funny .  in the opening scene jack along with montoya and the team of vampire hunters , find an abandoned house to which vampire occupy .  of course we all know sunshine kills vampires , and that is just how they kill these vampires : hooking them to ropes and dragging them outside letting them burn to death .  after throwing a party for what happened , the vampires that did not die come back to trash it .  they kill almost all of jack's team , leaving only a few alive .  sheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek , but not yet turned into a vampire .  she is rescued by jack and ? flees with them on their search for valek .  they have to fight they're way against vampires , leading up to a finale that is well-done with great special effects .  'vampires' definately could have been done better .  the make-up , special effects and story are first rate , but there is no scares or terror that the film could have had .  it to me had more humor than horror , almost being compared to 'fright night' with the mix of violence and comedy .  john carpenter does a great job of directing this film .  he eases through some tough times and saves the flaws , which are noticeable but forgettable .  the script is clever and funny , with many lines that make us laugh out loud .  i much enjoyed 'vampires' with a few exceptions .  it's one of those films you see but don't take to heart .  you enjoy the time you spent and go on .  the recently released 'psycho' is the same way , it's not as good as you'd hope but it is fun and entertaining .  'vampires' is a good horror flick with no scares but plenty of other content to please the viewer .  
1 near the end of frank capra's holiday classic , its a wonderful life , george bailey ( jimmy stewart ) is feeling down .  he has devoted his life to others , and never fulfilled his dream of leaving his small supburb town , bedford falls .  standing upon a bridge above stormy waters , he looks down , contemplating suicide .  he has potential he hasn't fulfilled -- yet , he has done so much for others .  as a young chap , his ambition was to leave his hometown of bedford falls .  but times and ambitions change .  things happen , and he's stuck .  his guardian angel is there , and shows him that . . . it's  a wonderful life .  in a whirlwind tour of the town , george sees what life would be like without him .  he learns the moral lesson , that to live is a gift .  his earthly problems are solved .  the climatic scene is a marvel .  frank capra's film is a centenial classic -- watched and re-experienced by every generation .  wonderful life is one of the few pictures of times gone by that seems as fresh , maybe fresher , then it did when it was first released .  many films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly .  but this one is a near flawless example of how well a perfect script and timing can mesh with first-rate acting , wit and suspense , glorious music , and terrific set peices .  the only even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in which god has a long chat with clarence , george's guardian angel .  they aren't all that bad , but they remain corny and a little out of place .  nevertheless , this is one film that deserves its place in time , cinema history , and our hearts .  it can be equally appreciated by anyone of any age .  here is one genuine masterpeice , a classic that reaches heights and ambitions near perfection .  this crackling good mixture results in a film which is at once funny , exciting , moving and uplifting .  the film itself is almost a reversal of the life of george bailey -- there isn't too much to it , but capra and the gang ( various screenwriters , composers , actors ) plumet the material to its fullest potential .  the result is a film -- though not at first intended to be pigeon-holed as a holiday film -- that will always be remembered , celebrated , and loved .  
1 as feel-good formulaic as it may be in its own way , shall we dance ?  also demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you don't often find in american films .  this japanese import tells the story of a middle-aged accountant named sugiyama ( koji yakusho ) whose mundane life is shaken up one night when he spots beautiful mai kishikawa ( tamiyo kusakari ) in the window of a dance school .  intrigued by her melancholy demeanor ( and slightly infatuated with her ) , sugiyama signs up for weekly classes at the school -- and , much to his amazement , ends up as attracted to dancing itself as to his young sensei .  meanwhile , sugiyama's wife ( hideko hara ) becomes suspicious of his late wednesday nights , and sets a private detective on her husband's trail .  in a hollywood film , you can bet that sub-plot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings .  in shall we dance ? , writer/director masayuki suo dispenses with it in a matter of minutes , using it to set up later character interactions rather than letting it overwhelm the story with pratfalls .  neither does he make the climactic moment of victory a competition between the hero and some mean-spirited token rival .  suo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter , allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them .  an opening prologue in shall we dance ?  goes to some effort to place the film in a sociological perspective , explaining how contrary ballroom dancing is to the japanese sense of propriety .  it's a forced message in a story which doesn't need such a culture-specific angle .  the dance school in shall we dance ?  plays the role of a singles' mixer , with everyone vaguely embarrassed to be there yet taking the opportunity to try on new personalities .  most amusing among these new personalities is the one adopted by sugiyama's co-worker mr . aoki ( naoto takenaka ) , a balding systems analyst who becomes a fiery latin lover when he dons a frizzy wig and begins to rumba .  sugiyama's awakening is less overt , but koji yakusho does a wonderful job showing a transformation of small steps .  it's a delicate performance with a huge heart .  shall we dance ?  is a fairly lightweight experience , which makes its final half hour rather a long sit .  suo crams a lot of exposition into very little time , including an unnecessarily detailed back-story for mai , resulting in a sluggish march towards the resolution .  it is here that shall we dance ?  feels most hollywood-conventional , attempting to blind-side the audience with a truckload of emotional catharsis .  suo might have been better advised to conclude with the small gem of a scene in which sugiyama and his wife take their first tentative dance steps together .  that's the real joy of dance shall we dance ?  conveys : its ability to create an intoxicating mood of romance which can soften the stiffest shirt .  
0 if anything , " stigmata " should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another .  of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst .  i suppose i should have seen this coming .  after all , " blair witch " thoroughly creeped me out , " sixth sense " was mildly spooky , and then " stir of echoes " had its moments , but wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over .  clearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping .  is it then any surprise that " stigmata " is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ?  no , not really .  patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother .  as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest .  the priest's church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue .  father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue .  his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ .  father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie' s story , considering she's an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on .  he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church .  as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a " fifth gospel " before they were excommunicated .  the new rupert wainwright music video .   .   .  i mean film " stigmata " is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse .  indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it's only interesting for about five minutes .  i'm not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school .  his camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing .  what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , " see ?  look at what i can do !  i'm an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . "  maybe then he'd explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) .  if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn't see it .  just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever .  arrrrrrrghhhh .   .   .  then again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn't bother me if " stigmata " had a story or characters that were remotely engaging .  though wainwright's vanity certainly doesn't help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script .  where are plot continuity and character development when you need them ?  case in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren't given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her .  the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she's kind of cute , so let's start the bleeding !  the fact that she's clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn't help , either .  according to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ?  go clubbing !  sure , that makes sense .  arquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking .  scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable .  even though frankie page's life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon .  even more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances .  father andrew's religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic .  as for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , " i'll get you , my pretty , " for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded .  trust me , i'm not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain .  what's worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible .  first of all , the film doesn't even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ?  how come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ?  actually , i'm not sure what frankie was posessed by .  supposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) .  which one is it ?  the answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time .  furthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church .  if you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you'll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library .  there's nothing the catholics need to worry about , though .   " stigmata's " religion is so off-base that it can't be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church .  if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting .  i'm not catholic ; in fact , i don 't care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means .  it's rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as " stigmata " does .  it' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be .  i'm not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story .  maybe it's an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever .  the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over .  like so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill .  so much is overdone in " stigmata , " that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film's ( many ) flaws .  i'm also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering .  when we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing .  the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and " stigmata " is it .  
1 i've never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski .  the part of jeff " the dude " lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect .  the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians .  he's enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes .  after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug .  the dude assumes that these " collection agents " were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l . a . so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug .  the millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped .  he wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers .  dude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers .  comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny .  it is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films .  not only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure .  all the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived .  each person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension .  the characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh .  it's not what they do that's funny , it's who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie .  worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that's jee-zus , not hay-soos ) , the greaser bowler who's in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as " vaginal ; " steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long-winded narrator .  aside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue .  people lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends . . .  they sound natural .  taken with fargo , the coen brothers' last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers .  ethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he's also good at technical directing .  he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film .  perhaps " beautiful " is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty .  but the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film .  all around , the big lebowski is great , solid comedy .  outstanding acting , writing , direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success .  
0 by-the-numbers : a film which introduces characters , situations , dilemmas and developments that we've seen before in a parade of other films .  a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one .  a film which is packed to the cap with predictability , leading to very little tension , excitement , suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience .  in short , a clich ? -ridden formula film .  welcome to my review of the general's daughter .  plot : an undercover army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughter's rape , torture and murder .  they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hush-hushes , to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder .  critique : by the numbers ( see above ) .  this film is just there .  it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours , floats around , goes away , hopefully never to be heard from again .  it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away .  it's as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree .  it's as action-packed as a canadian curling tournament .  get the picture ?  i sure did . . . it's  too bad that it took my friend and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot , and to break down each scene before it was even completed .  easy as pie .  it's unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film , but alas , t'was not to be ( that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted . )  woods chews it up in the few scenes that he's in , travolta passes the test , cromwell plays , well , cromwell , and stowe is window dressing with a smile ( mia since 12 monkeys ( 8/10 ) it seems ) .  and this predictability isn't reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men , it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen .  it's like riding a bike .  other scenarios which sponge out any tension , suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually " breaking down " to the investigators without much reason given , a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters , as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly , and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the " best poor man's michael bay doing his best poor man's impression of tony scott " ( add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half-open shades for grit and integrity , and an all-out rainfall for the finale for further chaos , and you're a great director .  yawn .  yeah , whatever tony . . . i  mean , simon . )  and aren't we all sick of hearing about these army " bad boys " and their overdone " code of silence " ? !  enough already !  next subject , please .  see it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing a much better movie like an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) .  otherwise , save yourself the trouble and go take a crap instead .  you'll feel much better afterwards .  trust me .  little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , john travolta turned down the lead role in an officer and a gentleman , which eventually went to little dickie gere .  ironically on james woods' part , he completed one of his earliest acting roles on tv's " welcome back , kotter " , starring none other than john travolta .  actor james woods recently confirmed reports of his " big dick " on howard stern's radio program .  unlike rocker tommy lee , woods is also alleged to have an iq of 180 .  he apparently scored a perfect 800 on his verbal sats and a 779 on the math section .  what a man !  john travolta is married to actress kelly preston , and they have a son named jett ( travolta loves them planes ! ) .  word on the street is that the kid was apparently conceived during a weekend at demi moore and bruce willis' home .  director simon west's first film was the jerry bruckheimer produced con air ( 6 . 5/10 ) .  before that , he directed tv commercials including the budweiser ad with the dancing ants .  yippee !  veteran director john frankenheimer ( ronin ( 7 . 5/10 ) ,  the manchurian candidate ) portrays the character of general sonnenberg in this film .  the imdb reports that when senator robert kennedy was shot at the ambassador hotel in los angeles on june 5 , 1968 , it was his good friend john frankenheimer who had personally driven him there that day .  clarence williams iii , who plays colonel fowler in this film , is known to some from his role as " linc " in the original " mod squad " tv series .  younger folk may remember him as prince's father in purple rain .  
0 there have been merchant-ivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than " the mod squad , " a self-consciously " hip " cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many baby-boomers .  well , said " squad " certainly won't be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else , maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards .  a contemporary take on this decidedly '70s show doesn't exactly seem unwarranted , but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didn't transform into a full-blown case of botulism .  how curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad , insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time .  they are julie , pete and linc , reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd ( exposition put out of the way so fast that you're likely to be lost from the opening moments on ) , and they are respectively played by claire danes , giovanni ribisi and omar epps , talented actors each deserving of better than this .  their plight involves standard cop-corruption stuff , as our would-be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover-up after their superior ( reliable dennis farina , one of the best things here and gone so quickly ) gets killed and framed for drug trafficking .  they pout a lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others .  when you're supposed to be asking , " what's going to happen next ? " ,  you'll instead entertain thoughts like " who are these people and why should i care ? "  or " aren't thrillers supposed to contain thrills ? "  not that danes , epps and ribisi don't give it a shot .  danes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep , as evidenced by " my so-called life , " but she's saddled with a mysterious-boyfriend ( josh brolin ) subplot so see-through you begin to seriously question her so-called intelligence .  ditto for ribisi's ( " saving private ryan " ) looney loose cannon , though at least he performs with a wild-and-crazy vigor that occasionally demands attention .  but epps - poor epps .  epps ( " higher learning " ) is so short-changed he's reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to chase him .  all this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters , one of whom , scott silver , is also the director .  they must think that if they dress up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings ( the look of the film is really quite impressive ) , it'll somehow pay off , but this " mod squad " plods anyway .  characters are non-existent ; present are just some good-looking young things modeling cool levis and cooler attitudes .  plot hardly escapes confusing convention .  and the one genre element you'd think would be show up in generous portions - a few nifty explosions , some fights , any kind of action whatsoever - only rarely makes it to this dull gabfest .  all those quick to put down last month's inept but serviceable " my favorite martian " update need to take a step back .  here's a small-to-big-screen translation that really should've stayed in its former incarnation , " mod " or not .  
1 disney's 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with , well , the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center .  great wit , great art , and a great villain ( james woods as hades , lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero , his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ) , and a largely unremarkable soundtrack .   ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy .  some lack lyrical snap .  others need more memorable melodies .  boring ballads we expect , but boring production numbers , too ? )  so , hercules is a bit of a long sit , but you won't stay bored .  the highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ) , a steady stream of anachronisms ( " somebody call ix-i-i " ) and pop references ( " let's get ready to rumble ! " ) a la aladdin , and several long-overdue jabs at the mouse's marketing and merchandising depart- ments .  while not as rock-solid as hunchback , it's a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas .  directed by ron clements and john musker , with voice credits including tate donovan , susan egan , bob goldthwait , matt frewer , samantha eggar , paul shaffer , and , as lighting bolt zeus , rip torn , who's having a very good summer , also appearing in trial and error and men in black .  
1 based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider-man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half-vampire half-human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire's latest meal .  now swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all .  his latest challenge is his biggest though . . . he  must stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires .  admitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some .  judging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film .  to some degree , i agree with this sentiment .  having read comic books since the age of nine ( i'm 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , #5 , blade .   ( " men in black " is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book )  why is this ?  for the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand  the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match .  the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided .  the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect .  superman  is not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this .  blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere .  this is in stark contrast to joel schumacher's contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960's television show .  batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i'm working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i'm ready ) .  which brings me back to blade .  although he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon .  the film depicts a vicious vampire killer that  uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends .  the end results are not pretty by any means .  the story elements work very well -- for a comic book story .  screenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films .  this is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n'bushe wright .  this leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires .  add this  to the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an " anti-theft device " ) , and one has an interesting premise .  however , the film works best as an action film .  actor wesley snipes has  an extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move .  proving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a  good example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes .  regardless , this film is far from perfect .  the film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god .  the ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on  marked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square ) .  obvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either ) .  much of the special effects are not that spectacular either .  while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film's release date was pushed back multiple times ) .  scenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i'm really hard to impress ) .  the film's r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of  realism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence ,  watch " saving private ryan " ) .  the overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin , both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi .  still , scenes involving non-cgi special effects do surface ( and look much more impressive ) , such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade's sword without deactivating the " anti-theft device " .  wesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess .  while not talking much , he is a grand physical presence , leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust .  a decent ( by comic book film standards ) storyline also helps .  
1 in zoolander , the world's most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , " is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? "  obviously , the film's creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ?  no , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more .  much like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie .  it's not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek's model roommates all die in a tragic " gasoline fight " accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) .  but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused .  better yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag .  zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs .  fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed .  enter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight .  on the trail of mugatu's plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller's real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she's hoping to use mugatu's pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme .  much like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today .  wilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel .  ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers .  jerry stiller -- ben's dad who's best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek's slimy agent maury ballstein .  even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse .  as for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he's stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners .  unfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here .  maybe it's just because i can't stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn't had sex in two years .  she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would've added real comic substance to the flimsy role .  while zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days .  zoolander's no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction .  
0  " showgirls " is the first big-budget , big-studio film to receive an nc-17 rating .  and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence .  but if " showgirls " is any indication of hollywood's future , the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values--bad moviemaking .   " showgirls " is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene , and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter .  director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas , who collaborated on another shock-value project , 1992's " basic instinct , " follow the plight of a young woman ( teen tv star elizabeth berkley ) determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer .  it's a hackneyed premise to begin with , so not surprisingly , all of the stock characters are trucked out .  there's the demanding producer .  the loyal friend .  the bitchy competitor .  lest i forget the scummy club owner .  of course , any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film's main attraction--an endless parade of full-frontal nudity .  unfortunately , " showgirls " doesn't satisfy in this department .  verhoeven's slam-bang , in-your-face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic .  to make matters worse , you'll be forced to sit through the movie's clothed scenes , which don't cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history .  verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground , but if it's adult entertainment you want , stay home and watch the playboy channel .  you'll be the wiser for it .  
0  " we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us . "  starring lee kang-sheng , yang kuei-mei directed by tsai ming-liang written by tsai and yang ping-ying cinematography by liao peng-jung  taiwan , 24/12/99 .  the millenium approaches .  an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city .  sectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus .  the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners .  the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week's time .  residents are advised to evacuate the area , asap .  this premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas .  the quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that .  the virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background .  instead , the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities .  the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible .  it's a vivid setting , but an unappealing one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background .  the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman's .  one day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man's living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman's living room .  this hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character's lonely , compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways .  example : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole .  the woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up .  this is what passes for meaningful communication .  and they say romance is dead .  much of the film does not even focus on their interactions , such as they are .  there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people .  they are ciphers .  instead , we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch , for instance , as the woman boils some water , pours it onto some noodles , then eats the noodles .   ( this is as fascinating as it sounds . )  offered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers , fantasies in which the woman lip-synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular , so i'm told , in 1950s' china ) .  she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells , incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights .  sometimes , in these fantasies , she is joined by the man .  these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful , sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality , but they fail .  when the man and the woman dance , it seems half-hearted and listless .  astaire and rogers this is not .  even in imagination , these people are numb , weary , boring .  the hole is part of the 'collection 2000' series , a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium .  others include canada's last night , brazil's midnight , and american hal hartley's the book of life .  the book of life is the only other one that i have seen , and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry .  witty , energetic , humane , it makes the the hole seem ( ahem ) empty .  american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements , quick cuts , superficial emotions .  foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does : they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time , and call it art .  the hole is self-evidently a film about alienation , and perhaps director tsai ming-liang wants the audience to share in his characters' alienation .  if so , he succeeds .  perhaps it is a challenge : he dares us to enjoy this movie , despite his best attempts to ensure that we don't .  if it was a challenge , i wasn't up for it .  
1 seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p . m . at crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #15 , by myself for free using my hoyts' critic's pass .  [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture]  do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just become part of a story ?  everyone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless ) .  that seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways .  in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors .  these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out .  how they will all come together is the process the film deals with .  i'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general .  the film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what's to come .  we meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent .  she's not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works .  maybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character , but she's far from masculine - a creative character indeed .  things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences .  this agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug .  the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death .  nearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be .  once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle .  when the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling .  considering how good it is up until that point , it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today .  and so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting .  the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead .  simon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined .  the third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna's story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle .  we're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna .  and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were .  i'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film .  perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking .  still , i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well :   ? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman , it's a great accomplishment .  he doesn't just depict a story , he wraps us up in it all , pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low .   ? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general , it's clear the script has been inspired by many sources , with both obvious and subtle references , yet it never screams `rip-off . '   ? tone/mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre .  it's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like `macabre light .

0 after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors , mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball .  fiercely unoriginal , director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him .  there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind .  the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars .  the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13 .  interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001 : a space odyssey .  instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie , de palma stops right there , refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart .  mission to mars takes it's first wobbly steps at a pre-launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done .  during these surface scans of the characters , we learn that jim mcconnell ( sinise ) has lost his wife .  it's a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety .  the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability .  there is no contentiousness , no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time .  maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff , but in that movie , the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects .  it's the year 2020 and this is nasa's first manned excursion to the red planet .  a crew , led by luke graham ( cheadle ) , arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly , which they investigate with tragic results .  graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth .  in response , earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell , woody blake ( robbins ) , wife terri fisher ( nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( o'connell ) .  obstacles are put in the crew's way and and they matter-of- factly go about solving them .  i should say , mcconnell goes about solving them .  time and again , mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind , which wouldn't be so bad if the rest of the crew didn't come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable .   ( mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crew's mission and life is in mortal danger .  on a team of professionals , she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link .  women serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male character's personality trait . )  by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred , mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush .  there is an adage in film to " show , don't tell . "  mission to mars does both .  repeatedly .  characters obsessively explain the obvious , explain their actions as they are doing them , explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them .  the film's conclusion is momumentally derivative , anti-climatic and unsatisying .  as i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film .  the best i could come up with is pre-teen age boys , but in this media saturated era , this film's components would have been old hat even for them .  i have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good , modern day b-movie .  the key to such a venture is a certain depth and sincerity towards the material .  i felt no such earnestness .  
1 the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily .  three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making .  they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house .  from there , things become a little more complicated .  i can say , with absolute assurance , that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me .  although i know it was all a staged " mockumentary " , there's no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you .  i didn't feel much upon initially watching it .  i just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts .  i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend .  i've gotten chills every time i've brought it up since then .  this is not a movie that hits you right away .  instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine , waits until you think everything is okay , then it slowly starts to creep it's way up into your mind .  this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch .  the film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film , so don't expect any steadi-cam shots or fancy camera work .  this is as real as it gets folks .  i don't recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though , because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera .  the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real , you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not .  this is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing , especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera .  the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape-to-film transfer done for the big screen .  word has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras ( hours of deleted scenes , alternate endings , commentary , the sci-fi channel special , and others ) is being planned for release .  i urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvd's .  i know i'll be first in line to buy one .

0 the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 , a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience .  being a surprise commercial and critical success , it had no marketing tie-ins , which limited its final take .  thus , babe 2 arrives , with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1 .  plush dolls , vending machines hawking t-shirts , and macy's thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money-grubbing .  too late .  this is a sad review to write , because babe 2 not only does _not_ live up to the original , but it doesn't even come to a fraction of it .  i shouldn't expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors' magic , but this film tries too hard , and loses its charm .  consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity , unaware that his car is in neutral .  imagine with me , if you will , _scream_'s jamie kennedy , explaining the " rules " for sequels like babe 2 .   ( 1 ) there must be _more_ talking animals .   ( 2 ) there must be _more_ slapstick comedy .   ( 3 ) there must be _more_ songs for those mice to sing : that's cute .   ( 4 ) keep the story cards to break up the action : that's cute too , even though " the pig gets wise " made no sense , given the context of that story partition .   ( 5 ) there must be action , however illogical , that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original : the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to , the baa-ram-ewe secret code , the " that'll do , pig .  that'll do . "  now throw in the limitations : ( a ) james cromwell , now a hot commodity , has limited time on the set ( or maybe he didn't approve of the script ) .   ( b ) christine cavanaugh , the voice of the original babe , demands more money ( $200 , 000--paltry considering the $80 million budget ) .  out .  e . g .  daily comes in with noticable results .   ( c ) george miller , the director , is more well-known for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment , not for kiddie fare ( and no , he didn't direct that _andre_ film in '94 ) .   ( d ) the special effects are impressive , _but limited_ .  babe talks , but most of the time from a single shot , repeated over and over again .   ( babe is center screen , looking straight into the camera , with a happy smirk--regardless of whether he's happy , or scared , or tired ) .  season now with the " original " elements , which , as we will find out , are straight from the screenwriting-is-hell bin .   ( i ) change the venue into " the big city " .  this has been praised as wildly original .  excuse me : didn't _home alone_ do this several years ago ?  how about the muppets ?  even _the bad news bears_ travelled to tokyo .  sorry .  no dice .  side note : to give the city a fairy-tale look , george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the world's great cities , and yes , it _is_ impressive .  but this too is over-used , repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions .  and , for the most part , babe _remains in the hotel_ .   ( ii ) given the limitations of cromwell , the human element is taken over by " the boss' wife " played by magda szubanski .  s-t-r-e-t-c-h .  she's not a lead actress-type , she's not funny enough in her physical comedy , and she's simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls .   ( have her arrested falsely on drug charges !  have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes !  have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner ! )  i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes , but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in .  i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film , the violence , the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge , head submerged underwater .  even the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it , as the brothers grimm have demonstrated .  no . . . my problem is with the story , or lack thereof .  _babe_ is sent out to save the hoggett farm , but once in the city , that story is forgotten .  being a good-natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice , but , other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull , what did babe actually _do_ ?  without giving the ending away , the farm is saved from a left-field quirk that had nothing to do with the pig .  speaking of " pig " , or , " pig-pig-pig-pig-pig ! " .  the word " pig " is so overused , had they changed it to an expletive , and had the pig be al pacino , i could have been watching _scarface_ .  this is screenwriting ?  further , i cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups .  had it been a cartoon , and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd , maybe my reaction would have been softened .  but to farmer hoggett ?  his wife ?  an elderly mickey rooney ?  much too irreverent .   ( " quick !  splice those singing mice into those scenes ! " ) .  the film isn't a colossal failure .  i did like glenne headley's schmoozy chimpanzee .  i liked the pink poodle .  the dog on the cart , who momentarily thinks he's in dog heaven .  and a weird looking guy who may have been doubly-cast as an airport employee and a judge .  but most of the time , i was looking down , in boredom , or in embarrassment over the hacked-up script .  them singing mice , those chapter partitions , the proficient acting of the animals-- none of these can compensate for a story .  let me spoil the final scene : farmer hoggett looks at pig , proud , says " that'll do , pig .  that'll do . "  that's it .  hope i didn't ruin it for you .  but tell me this : what the heck did that pig _do_ ?  
0 forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects .  set in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon .  they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells .  then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes .  not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood .  taking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ?  surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ?  the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play .  this is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale .  the play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere .  in the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box .  not only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted .  it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot .  not surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame .  when the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail .  with alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion .  abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft .  appropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched .  director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration .  otherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable .  ryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings .  her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful .  abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here .  paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves .  probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character .  a scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed .  unfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost .  it is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions .  his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message .  the result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable .  when the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed .  far from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience .  
1  " rebel without a cause " is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to .  everyone feels that they are different in some way , that they don't belong in some places and " rebel without a cause " successfully shows on screen these universal emotions .  no matter what generation you belong to , these feelings are present .  this is why james dean is admired by america , because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute .  in our minds , we just try to do the right thing just like dean's jim stark does .  not only does " rebel without a cause " display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure .  each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection .  this is because times change and in response people change .  no matter how popular you were once , as your generation grows older , newer breeds look at you in a different light .  this is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents .  even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past , the teens could not believe this .  in one humorous scene , stark , his girlfriend judy ( natalie wood ) , and his pal plato ( sal mineo ) pretend they are adults .  they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored .  this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another .  speaking on behalf of my generation , i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by .  the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation . same  goes for brando , redford , even deniro .  i can only imagine how vaguely matt damon , ben affleck , and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century .  will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten ?  any film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film .  even if " rebel without a cause " has some ridiculous scenes ( the game of chicken - did people really act this way ? ) , an unbelievable conclusion ( how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end ? ) , and a silly romance ( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours ) it still is a fabulous film .  the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool .  now , however , the coolness is fading . . .  
1 with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately , what with that whole clinton thing going on ( you know , 100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern - oh , please , government , waste my taxes just a bit more , would you ? ) ,  it's about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement .  with this and " crimson tide , " he's created two successfully chilly films that are interesting , exciting , even pretty smart , but never totally riveting as cinema , and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying , and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart .  that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them , and was appropriately scary and all , but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant .   " enemy of the state " is the same way : it's engrossing for its entire running time , and it's scary the way that it shows a man's decent into kafkaism , but it's too technical .  it's too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be .  it casts will smith , one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he's charming and witty and never uninteresting , and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person .  i hate to do this , but last year's film " the game " got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being , a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life , and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened .  the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling , but also the best mindfuck of the entire year .  not that i want every kafkaesque film to be " the game " ( this year's " the spanish prisoner " succeeds with less thrills and chills ) , but it should be an example of what works and what doesn't .  will smith's character is , frankly , too perfect , at least too movie perfect .  he had an affair with another woman ( lisa bonet , ha ha ) , but his relationship with his wife ( regina king ) is basically fine regardless .  he has a kid , and he's raking in money as a lawyer , albeit a very good and reasonably moral one .  so he generally doesn't have any real problems as a human being , and is therefore boring . . . except that he is played by will smith , who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering " id4 " / " men in black " territory .  he's a good dramatic actor ( just see the first half hour of " six degrees of separation " for proof of this , not that he isn't great the whole time ) , and here , he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character , which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities .  smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance , extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world , under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control , when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party ( a nature observer played by , uh , jason lee ) .  the government wants the disk , and is prepared to destroy his life to get it .  as smith's plight is dramatized , we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him , sitting in vans disguised as other businesses , staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet .  these guys ( played by jack black , jamie kennedy , and seth green ) are the most interesting part of this film because they're , well , fascinating : they're doing their jobs , which are evil , but the film doesn't view them as such , and they almost become our friends .  we like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn't automatically judge them as the villains .  they're also scary because we get the idea that they're not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world .  it's as if they're obsessed with their jobs , not because they're evil , but because , hey , it's a fun job , and no one else can do it like them .  unfortunately , this also backfires a bit on the film : instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that " the game " was , you see everything , and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on .  sure , you're chilled , but you're not exacty freaked out by what's going on .  but what do you expect from tony scott , the man who never met a five-second piece of film he ever liked .  he's a not-bad director because , hell , he is always interesting to watch ( if not occasionally moronic - exhibit a : " days of thunder " ) , but the reason he's not great is because he's too technical and calculated .  his shots are perfectly executed , and leave nothing to the imagination , and they're always making sure you're paying attention .  this is incredibly annoying , and it reduces " enemy of the state " to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths , but still manage to entertain without any real problems .  despite never actually becoming great , it's never actually boring and it's always intriguing .  watching the government set-up smith is endlessly fascinating , and since we care about smith's likeable protagonist , we are set-up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy-esque entertainment .  add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film ( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos ) , and you've got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith's plight without a minute's worth of boredom .  
0 this was the last carry on movie ( if you discount 'carry on columbus' as a carry on movie ) and was made by a new production company .  based in central london , this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert ( suzanne danielle ) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador ( kenneth williams ) .  when he seems unwilling , she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes , such as the prime minister and the u . s . ambassador .  her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages .  she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead .  meanwhile , theodore valentine ( larry dann ) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her .  however , she is only interested in restoring her husband's ardour which seems a little difficult after emile's accident with a church spire !  this film is the second worst carry on movie , the worst being 'carry on england' .  it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written .  newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid ( as mrs . valentine ) are mildly funny , but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad .  kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted , given the script .  the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler , joan sims as mrs . dangle , kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur , and peter butterworth as richmond , are worthless and embarassing .  in fact , all four parts are surplus to requirements .  however , the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades .  an awful script , a terrible collection of jokes , very poor production values ( especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st . james palace ) , a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score , and a non-existent plot or storyline .  its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next !  jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring , joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted , and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile .  a complete waste of time , this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies .  it was a certificate 15 film but by 1978 , there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998 !  avoid at all costs !  
1 apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether .  i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce .  as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton .  it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star .  norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year .  he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) .  the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car .  we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny .  in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother .  much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy .  when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things .  what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms .  it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material .  because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic .  i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart .  the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men .  it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up .  of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part .  it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest .  in addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease .  even when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead .  what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny .  the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien .  visually , the film is very powerful .  kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere .  but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes .  although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed .  for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way .  it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film .  perhaps this last scene was the problem .  it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way .  
0 staring , george clooney , arnold schwarzenegger , chris o'donnell and uma thurman with alicia silverstone .  well to start this off i'd just like to say a couple things .  first is , i miss michael keaton , i miss tim burton and would much prefer to think that these last two batman films are all like a dallas dream sequence .  not even from the first film was batman really the 'star' though he was damn close in the first couple anyway .  in 'batman forever' and now in 'batman & robin' he's almost pushed to being a bit player .  i can't really say if clooney ( who regardless was better than kilmer ) was a very good batman or not .  he's given next to nothing to do at all , he might as well not have been there and it wouldn't have made much difference .  now , joel schumacher has said that he refuses to bend to the masses that have hated his films and cheered for the return of buton that he wont make batman brooding and dark .  fine , i mean granted 'batman returns' while being an awsome film was a bit to dark sometimes .  yet his bright neon , campy style is just killing anything this series meant to me .  i'm usually very easy on films .  i loved 'con air' and other films some critics have slammed .  granted that film really was paper thin , cliche ridden , except for one thing , it was fun .  there is virtually no fun in this film at all .  i couldn't have cared less .  it'll thrill the little ones as theres no violence really , none everyone comes out fine in the end like those old tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing .  schwarzenegger is awful , i mean really , really bad . . .  and this is coming from a regular fan of his work .  i love his movies most of the time and the basic reason is he never says much in any of them .  he talks all to often in this movie .  i would have much prefered to have seen patric stewart in the roll .  i believe to truely like a film you have to care about at least someone in a film .  i liked alfred but the reason behind it is a cheap shot .  
1 ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here !  it's title : starship troopers .  and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 .  i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour .  after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review .  starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem .  as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film .  in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film .  starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether .  while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : " the 'star wars' of the 90s . "  am i being to generous to this film ?  perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races .  in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction .  the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to .  starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a " kick-the-aliens'-asses " style .  id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role .  this new " star wars " has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species .  the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects .  however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy .  sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization .  more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends .  and they should be .  i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film .  this is an " event " film , but surprisingly above average .  it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) .  starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange " join the army " ads .  mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original .  stating , " would you like to know more ? " ,  these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously .  however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way .  after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw .  we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) .  rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms .  however , carmen isn't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot .  however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico .  unfortunately , rico isn't interested in dizzy .  this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch .  carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up .  and as a result , dizzy signs up .  everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry .  the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships .  in reality , i found myself watching a space version of " melrose place , " but with better special effects .  an hour into the film , the war begins .  a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with .  the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) .  following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war .  the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else .  many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs' attacks .  a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense .  the troopers are ordered to locate the " brain " and capture it .  i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot .  it's about special effects and gory violence .  director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall .  verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood .  starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year's event horizon .  the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it .  my guess is that verhoeven's target audience is the 18 to 25 male group .  the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women .  despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful .  while watching the film , we never second guess the character's decisions because they seem perfectly clear .  thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with .  the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you .  casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon .  to most guys , he will come across as artificial .  fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character .  dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character .  her dizzy is extremely likeable .  denise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done .  jake busey , gary busey's son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film .  neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast .  however , he does give a good performance .  michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm .  his performance rises above the rest .  perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside's presence on screen .  unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars .  director verhoeven is the main star of the film .  his direction is fast and unrelentless .  he never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride .  writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein .  the writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny .  the dialogue is smart but not too smart .  we aren't required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered .  thankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don't ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) .  amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues .  in fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story .  the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage .  i haven't laughed this loud , even in some comedies .  oh , and the special effects are first rate .  starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity .  believe me when i say this : don't take young kids to see this film .  it is extremely violent .  in fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year .  however , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain .  it's been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys .  and still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world .  now that would be entertaining !  
1 barely scrapping by playing at a nyc piano bar , timothy hutton returns to his massachusetts hometown for a couple of weeks .  on the surface , he's coming home for a high school reunion , but since this is a movie , you know that he's really looking for some major life decisions .  a fairly " small " film , this sports an impressive ensemble cast including uma thurman , rosie o'donnell and a bunch of actors that you've seen before but can't quite place .  commendable jobs all around ; they seem like real people .  hutton arrives at his past and is greeted by his spirit-dead father , terminally goony brother and old high school chums .  all of his old buddies are engaged in the snow removal business and most are in the midst of a relationship crisis .  the perfect stuff for a comedy about people in the twenties angst .  he meets and falls for the new next door neighbor : a beautiful intelligent lively girl who is obviously taken with him .  the problem is that she is only 13 .  unconsummated ( no , it's not _that_ type of movie ) , their relationship builds and neither knows what to do with it .  star-crossed lovers with no where to go .  so hutton is gaga over a barely-teen , one of his buddies is two-timing his girlfriend with a married old flame , another's girlfriend is sleeping with a meat cutter ( " and she's a vegetarian ! " ) .  things are a mess .  enter uma thurman .  the beautiful stranger in town for a few days is both a delight in the film and one of its minor downfalls .  her character is fun to watch .  even more entertaining is observing the guys falling over themselves trying to impress her .  like the lone ranger , before she leaves , she solves most of the problems and sets everyone onward with their lives .  the ending is a bit too pat .  everything is tied up with a neat little bow .  rosie o'donnell is a stand-out in her limited screen time with her brash personality and " tell it like it is " pronouncements .  structured somewhat like a " diner , a few years later " , this feel-good story is a good time , but ends a little too nice .  
1 warning ! : may contain some mild spoilers and offensive material .  rated : r ( ! ) for sexual content , crude and sexual humor , and some nudity . .   ( a mild r rating )  starring : rob schneider , oded fehr , eddie griffin , arija bareikis , amy poehler , norm mcdonald .  running time : 88 minutes   " deuce bigalow : male gigolo " is simply a hilarious good-natured comedy that may offend some , but underneath all it's crude humor and sexual content is a sweet little love story that is surprisingly involving .  it isn't any kind of cinematic classic , but it's a very very funny comedy that keeps us entertained until the end credits which themselves are funny too .  it has all it needs to be a breezy entertaining comedy : the acting is up to pace and some of the performances quite funny , the screenplay is witty and smart , and the whole story is sweet and cute .  deuce bigalow ( rob schneider ) is your typically average guy : he cleans fish tanks for a living and gets an average of 10 bucks for it .  though one might call him a loser , deuce gets a job he would never thought he would get .  he gets to clean the tank for a male gigolo ( oded fehr ) and gets offered to watch over his place while he goes on a trip .  trying to be like him he hangs upside down from a pole and accidentally pushes off the fishtank and burns his cabinets .  the thing is now he has to try and find $6 , 000 dollars in three weeks to make sure everything looks right again .  so he decides to go " man-whoring " and to his luck gets the oddest people on earth : an over-weight woman who decidedly wants to eat everything in site , a woman with narcolepsy who sleeps all the time , a woman who has sudden screaming outbursts , and a woman he can't stop thinking about .  he charges $10 but he is willing to negotiate .  from now on he is considered deuce bigalow : male gigolo .  with non-stop laughs an a abundence of crude humor " deuce bigalow : male gigolo " is sometimes like last years hit " there's something about mary " that is offensive but very funny .  the screenplay by harris goldberg and rob schneider himself is a smart , clever and witty screenplay that seems to have been written with care to make is so hilariously funny .  the characters in the film are all actually likable especially " jabba lady " with her big body but soft heart .  there are actually times in the movie where i fell out of my chair laughing so hard that my stomach was killing me .  even though i thought " toy story 2 " and " being john malkovich " were the funniest of the year " deuce bigalow " follows right behind them .  the directing by mike mitchell is fantastic and shows he took time on the film .  rob schneider gives a surprisingly endearing performance and when his romance develops with one of his customers kate ( arija bareikis ) it is a sweet romance that we get involved in and actually like being involved in it .   " deuce bigalow " is a good-natured film worth all the merit it can get .  its not a classic or a masterpiece , it's just a comedy that we don't feel bad about watching .  sure it may come off as offensive and may come off as dumb sometimes , but you cannot deny that it isn't funny .   " deuce bigalow : male gigolo " is no disappointment .  its a fast paced , entertaining sweet and hilarious comedy that may be destined to become a cult classic .  fans of schneider will not be disappointed and fans of crude but nice comedies will not either .  for some reason the film garnered an r rating but with no " f words " or extensive use of sexual content or explicit nudity i was really wondering why the film was r . a mild r to put it to the least , but even if your under 17 or above at least 13 this film is good enough for you to see .  don't try to be one of those people who make so much of a film that they do not like it , just sit back , laugh and enjoy the movie .  
1 i hate to burst your bubble , but after all the star power , mega bucks , screenwriters , directors , and cool trailers , men in black is not the best movie of the summer .  it's pretty good in it's own right , yes , but i would probably split the " best movie " honors among face/off , spawn , con air , and maybe event horizon .  it's main problem is that it's quickly forgettable , and i can't remember one truly good scene from it .  from con air , it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt .  in spawn , it was the " living room hell " conclusion at the end .  in event horizon , it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell's forces .  and all of face/off was pretty dang good .  but as for men in black , the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches .  i remember it not for it's humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted .  and yes , i did see mimic , which is something i'll touch on in a later review .  back to men in black ( is it just me , or does that sound funny ? )  i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard , etc . ( for those of you who aren't comic-geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy's life is to boy scots .  okay , that one was pretty pathetic . )  few people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest-politician-rare , very hard to find .  this was after the release of the high-grossing batman forever , and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o'donnell were being considered for the roles ( in the comic book , there were no black men in black .  kind of weird , huh ? )  all i can say is , thank god they didn't cast chris o'donnell .  i know i can't be the only person on the planet who thinks he's an annoying , preppie little snot . . .  sorry .  my apologies to o'donnell fans .  i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him , anticipating rather craftily that , if the movie was a big hit , it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely .  he decided not to sell them to me , because they were " innappropriate " .  hmm . . . .  so now you're probably wondering why i've wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years .  good question .  i'll move on to the movie now .  as you probably already know , will smith and tommy lee jones ( agents k and j , respectively ) belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5 , or it's nickname mib ( men in black . )  men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear , and they're mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they're here on earth .  not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven't seen this movie , but a basically-big-roach-type-bug lands in a redneck farmer's yard , inhabits his body , and attempts to destroy the entire universe .  not bad , eh ? ( i have no idea why i just typed that .  i'm not even really paying attention anymore . )  the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black .  i found their main headquarters to be boring , as were the " cool weapons " they had .  the noisy cricket just plain sucked , no matter what anyone said .  and the movie definitely surprised me in tone , although it probably shoudln't have .  it's director , barry sonnenfield , is known for " black humor " , directing both addams family movies .  this movie was basically a " black comedy " , not an action/sci-fi like i expected from the trailers .  don't get me wrong on what i think of this movie .  it's not bad , i gave it * * * .  it was mostly entertaining throughout it's run , and had a very good ending , although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it .  my diagnosis for this picture : a good weekend rental , but not worth a movie ticket .  of course , the movie is now long gone from theaters , but that's beside the point .  i think .  
0  " come on , silent bob !  we're going to hollywood . "  starring jason mewes , kevin smith , will ferrell , shannon elizabeth , seann william scott , chris rock , jason lee , ben affleck .  directed by kevin smith .  rated r .  jay and silent bob strike back is a dumb movie disguised in a smarmy interior .  kevin smith , coming off the wonderful , challenging dogma , fills it with sub-road trip gross-out jokes and expects us to buy it because he's just oh-so-ironic .  but when a movie is so self-aware it becomes about nothing but itself , we can hardly be expected to pay for admission .  jay and silent bob , two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot , have appeared in almost all of smith's movies but , if i'm not mistaken , have not starred in one until now .  they find out that there is a movie based on the comic book that is based on them being made in hollywood .  this presents two problems : a ) they haven't received a penny in royalties and b ) nerds on the internet ( " what's the internet ? " )  are talking trash about them .  what is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made ?  on the way -- they're hitchhiking , because who knew you needed tickets to take a bus ?  -- they run into a group of hotties who pretend to be with an animal-rights group , but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlie's angels-style outfits .  of course , they set jay and silent bob up to look like the thieves , so that there is a massive manhunt going on during the second half of the film .  will ferrell , who again proves himself incapable of doing anything but sketch comedy , shows up as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks the two have stolen a monkey .  the movie will probably please only smith's die-hard , undiscerning fans ; everyone else will be critical of this mind-bogglingly stupid effort following some the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past .  any appeal the movie has will come from the " in " jokes , most of which i think i understood , but the movie is " in " to the point of absurdity .  there needs to be something holding it together other than its own smugness .  once jay and silent bob get to hollywood , the movie abruptly switches gears from gross-out comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire .  countless " hot " movie stars and personalities make an appearance , from smith veterans matt damon and ben affleck to wes craven , but jay and silent bob strike back resorts to such low-brow gags as another scream sequel with a monkey as the killer .  get it ?  they're so desperate for another movie , they ran out of ideas and used a monkey !  a monkey !  as often happens with writers who are working below what they are actually capable of , most of the really good lines are throwaways , while the big , painstaking gags mostly fall flat .  one of the funniest lines in the movie flies by : when asked to comment on the clitoris ( don't ask ) , jay responds : " the female clitoris ? "  kevin smith is a talented writer ( though i agree that his films would be better off if he'd let a real director take the helm ) , and jay and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to make a more facetious film .  unfortunately , it's also shapeless , pointless and largely unfunny .  smith's " verbal trampoline , " as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue , takes a back seat to his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker .  this was supposed to be the movie that didn't offend anyone , but it's offensive because it's terrible .  
0 writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard .  harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun .  harder than building a bridge over troubled waters .  and incidentally , a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review .  thrillers are all variations on a theme .  you have a smart , resourceful , and powerful bad guy , who has a goal he has to meet .  you have a noble and brave good guy , who has to protect the innocent , kill the bad guy , and not get killed himself in the process .  the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner .  this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest , high noon , or silence of the lambs , or big summer blockbusters like men in black , the fugitive , or air force one , or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds , event horizon , kull the conqueror . . . .  is anyone else getting depressed here ?  point is , it's not enough to follow the formula .  you've got to throw in something extra , something good and new and better than the last version .  something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals .  this is a hard thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary in every way .  without that something extra -- whether it's a great plot or a well-written screenplay , or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs -- the movie fails .  that's why the jackal , with all its starpower , with all its budget , with all its hype , gets a big fat f .  bruce willis is the bad guy , the jackal , a legendary killer for hire .  richard gere is the good guy , a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal .  the jackal is trying to kill someone .  gere is trying to stop him .  will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ?   ( i'll give you three guesses , and the first two don't count . )  there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal , no moment when you say to yourself , " i wonder what happens next ? "  the script for the jackal isn't ripped straight from today's headlines .  it's ripped off , straight from an episode of millennium .  throughout the movie , we learn what the jackal's plans are and how he intends to accomplish them .  no surprise .  the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal's plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy .  instead , we get two ( count 'em , two ) scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal's plan just as if he's frank black ( or more likely , just as if he's been handed a copy of the script ) .  and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight .  it's like gere's character is psychic , but neither he nor the fbi ( or the screenwriters ) seem to know it .  and just like in millennium , the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about , whether or not they are important to what he's trying to do or not .  what's more , in the last half of the movie , the jackal , supposedly a super-smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake , comes down with a major case of the stupids .  as for the performances . . .  bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack , which is a major achievement , but not enough reason to see the movie .  his disguises are good , but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer's in the saint .  richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent , which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance .  sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie -- not that his performance is bad or anything , it's not , but it is sad that hollywood won't use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent ( shoot to kill , sneakers ) .  writing a good plot and a good screenplay , like i said , is hard , but it can be done .  it wasn't done here .  it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones .  do not go see this movie .  you'll only encourage the producers to make more just like it .  instead , stay home and rent day of the jackal , or in the line of fire , or a fire safety video , for crying out loud .  anything other than the jackal , which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other , better movies .  
1 when i first saw the previews for ron howard's latest film , my expectations were discouragingly low .  a show about nothing ?  sounds like " seinfeld . "  a guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day ?  sounds like " the truman show . "  what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants , another puts one out about bugs ?  which is why i was pleasantly surprised by " edtv , " which turns out to be a fresh , insightful , and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity .  the writing , by howard's longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel , is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus .  in the hands of a less-experienced director , " edtv " could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday's meatloaf .  with their 'true tv' cable ratings being threatened by 'the gardening channel' ( apparently people would rather watch soil ) , the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers .  program director cynthia topping ( ellen degeneres ) comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment .  the hook is to find a regular guy , someone normal that people can relate to .  while scouting possible candidates , cynthia's camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray ( woody harrelson ) in a bar , where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame .  but on watching the videotape , the show's producers are more taken with ed than with ray .  he's cute , he says all the wrong things , and he's 100% usda hick .  cynthia's boss , played by rob reiner , gives the show a week to deliver the goods and it's tough going in the early stages .  the most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth .   " action shot ! "  wags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster .  you get the idea .  but soon enough , things--nielsen-boosting kinds of things--start to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the 'true tv' cameras are right there to document it .  ed's privacy is no longer his own , his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life , and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media .  who should ed go out with ?  you can be sure the pollsters have a list .  not only is the film exceedingly well cast , but its performers are consistently excellent .  matthew mcconaughey provides the face , the body language , and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of america's latest phenomenon .  he and harrelson look like they really could be brothers .  sally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed's mother , and martin landau is one of the film's highlights as al , ed's ailing stepfather .  jenna elfman ( from tv's " dharma and greg " ) proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau , although those alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting .  even degeneres and reiner are better than you'd expect .  in 1979 , writer/director/comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called " real life " in which a small-time opportunist makes a real-time documentary about a typical american family .  the scenes of ed's family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a big-budget variant on that film , paralleling its wickedly inventive humor .  as with most films by albert brooks , " real life " was funny , but absurd .  the funniest--and scariest--thing about " edtv " is that it is absolutely believable .  
0 after enduring mariah carey's film debut , glitter , i'm reminded of a bit from chris rock's bigger and blacker .  in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , " you can drive a car with your feet , but that don't mean it should be done . "  to that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly don't mean it should be done .  sure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles' a hard day's night to the spice girls' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter .  everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous .  start off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie .  the film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers .  worse yet , everyone's speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 .  meant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother .  influential club dj julian dice , a . k . a . " lucky 7 " ( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro ) , hears her sing on a track , and decides to make her a star .  in predictably rapid succession , billie and dice fall for each other , she starts hitting it big , dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass , and suddenly billie's on " the roller coaster of superstardom . "  in the meantime , billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom .  i won't give away the ending , but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows . . .  you'll figure it out .  the movie screams to be made with camp , and that could've been fun .  but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better .  what a mistake .  the brief attempts at comic relief -- as in a scene where an effeminate russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie's first music video -- go over like lead balloons .  instead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah's most dramatic scenes .  which brings us to the performances , of which there's nothing good that can be said .  mariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face .  she actually looks scared during her one love scene .  but you have to wonder if the writing isn't even worse .  so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey's virginal target audience that it's probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb .  even the characters couldn't have been written more absurdly .  they're all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , " billie , i'd love to put you in a movie i'm making , " and the big-time record executive who takes billie's demo tape and says , " oh , i'll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . "  everyone in the film is a device , and it's painful to keep watching just to see another one appear .  to say more would be a waste .  there's so much wrong with this film .  and , it pains me that mariah carey -- with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days , as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays -- will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she's likely to get .  but , then again , i had to suffer through her movie .  
0 while i am not fond of any writer's use of cheap , easy puns , i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it ( witness my review of _pecker_ from a couple of issues ago ) .  so here goes : the juvenile , college-set black comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival .  strait-laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout ) 's blemish-free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate , cooper ( mark-paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze-filled nights that come with university life .  with the threat of losing an academic scholarship ( josh ) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming ( cooper ) , what are two good-hearted slackers to do ?  easy--look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student's ( or students' ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as .  so instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends .  director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper's diabolical plot .  until then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar's sitcom-bred mugging .  that said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it .  the introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) .  one wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for .  not surprisingly , he does resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty .  the same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ .  whatever morbid appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self-absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get-go .  _dead_man_ doesn't grow tiresome ; it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through .  as it slogs along to a cheesy , happy-for-all-parties conclusion , _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on . . .  like a zombie .  
1 synopsis : shrek ( myers ) is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest , until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) .  farquaad agrees to relocate the pests , on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona ( diaz ) -- whom farquaad desires to wed -- from a far-off castle .  grudgingly , shrek sets out , joined in his quest by an unwanted companion , donkey ( murphy ) .  review : one memorable aspect of disney's " aladdin " was that it finally gave robin williams a character -- the genie -- to best take advantage of his comic talents .   " shrek " does the same for eddie murphy ; ironically , though , murphy's ideal vessel turns out to be an ass .  all the same , " shrek " does represent murphy's best comic outing in years , and as donkey he steals all the best lines .  for instance , after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature , donkey soars into the air and scoffs , " now i'm a flying talking donkey ! "  and despite its many contributors , the script for " shrek " is full of such comic gems .  myers is delightful in more of a straight man role , and lithgow also gets some great moments ( watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man ) .   " shrek " takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts , and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain .  things do go somewhat astray during the film's middle segment , which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie's greatest strength .  but even then , one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation , whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology .  
1 america has finally gotten what it's needed for years : a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics and charisma .  regretfully it's only a movie .  president james marshall ( harrison ford ) is fed up with terrorist activities .  teaming up with the russian government , he orders a strike force capture of alexander radek , a reactionary general ready to re-unite the soviet union under his fascist reign .  during a celebration dinner , marshall announces to the world that he will send troops to fight oppression wherever it exists .   " it's your turn to be afraid , " he declares .  returning home on air force one , he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally .  ultra-nationalist militants loyal to radek and lead by ivan korshunov ( gary oldman ) hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until the general is released .  marshall has a chance to escape in a jettisoned capsule ( which clinton says doesn't exist in real life ) but refuses , preferring to stay and fight .  director wolfgang peterson ( " das boot " , " in the line of fire " , " outbreak " takes the over-used " die hard " theme and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with hold-your-breath intensity .  if you can take your eyes off the screen , steal a look at the audience .  everyone is totally engrossed .  the two actors do what they do best and they are probably the best there are at it .  oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist and no wonder -- he does it so well .  when he engages the teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead , you know that he's over the edge in the manner that people with a cause can become .  you are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any time .  when korshonov executes passengers , there is a frightening reality to it .  the guns in this film are deadly weapons , not cartoons .  harrison ford has done one role for several years .  his mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here .  marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job .  realistically , he's a man afraid , but not afraid to act .  ford is one of the few actors that could make us believe that the president of the united states could be an action hero .  indiana jones in the oval office .  he and oldman's archetypes match up perfectly .  the other roles also go to accomplished actors .  glenn close as the determined but unsure vice-president is the picture of an executive forced into a position that she's not quite ready for .  dean stockwell as defense secretary eager for the authority ( " i'm in charge here ! " )  is her political nemesis and turns in a good alexander haig performance .  of course the politics are all wrong .  a cowboy president ( even down to his name ) with big guns shoots his way through problems .  much like the american collective memory of jfk's camelot , the image is wondrous if you don't look too deep .  the pulls on the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film , but they work here .  no matter what political spin you put on the story , the movie is an outstanding one .  i left the theater feeling that there is hope for the country's future : not a common belief nowadays .  now if we only can get ford to run for president .  just because one actor didn't work out as chief executive doesn't mean that a different one couldn't .   ( michael redman has lost count of how many years he's been writing this column -- 21 years . . . 22 years -- while watching the sunflowers outside his window swaying in the cool breezes . )  
0 the first image in " final fantasy : the spirits within " is a computer-animated close-up of a human eye .  it's a beautiful piece of work , remarkably detailed and quite convincing .  when the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye , however , things change .  the young woman has mesmerizing hair , although it hangs too artfully ? even by movie standards ? to be believed .  the facial features are more detailed than any computer-animation seen to date , but the result is more reminiscent of a very well-crafted doll than anything human .  she is pretty , but bland , and not nearly expressive enough to come off like a person .  all the characters in " final fantasy " are like that .  of the core group , the younger white men and women are all athletic , attractive and indistinct , like applicants for a tv reality show .  the black man is taller and burlier , and the aging scholar is bald , with wrinkles and a beard .  none of them appear to be based on individuals ; they all look like the products of general descriptions given a police sketch artist .  it gets worse when they talk and move .  why is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi , he of the great twisted face and snaggleteeth , coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll ?  why , for every fluid physical gesture , do we also see herky-jerky puppet-style motions ?  more to the point , who decided a full-length computer animated movie featuring " hyperreal " ( their term , not mine ) humanoids was a good idea ?   " final fantasy " is based on a phenomenally popular video game i've never played , with a story straight out of japanese anime , which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed .  if you're a fan of either , please spare me your letters , as i will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials .  with an expression-challenged cast , " final fantasy " mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit .  the result is ugly , confusing and boring .  note : the following reveals the basic plot .  if you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie , i suggest you read it .  earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls .  most of our planet is devastated , with humans living in a few protected cities .  while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies , aki ross ( voiced by ming-na ) and her mentor , dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) , believe in a more organic approach .  they operate on the notion ( quoting straight from the press kit ) " that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained .  aki and dr . sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force .  the waves will , in effect , cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion .  they have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave .  they are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out . "  are you still with me ?  there's only a little more .  aki is infected with the alien force .  dr . sid has developed a method of confining the contagion and keeping it from killing her , but the defense wall won't hold much longer .  already , the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams .  aiding aki and dr . sid are the deep eyes , a group of hard-as-nails types that would have felt at home with the troops in " aliens . "  capt . gray edwards ( alec baldwin ) heads the task force that consists of a wise guy ( buscemi ) , a tough woman ( peri gilpin ) and a gentle giant ( ving rhames ) .  throwing a monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass : in this case general hein ( james woods ) , who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens back to the stone age , even if it destroys earth as well .  so there you have it .  like most of the anime i've seen , the plot combines apocalyptic settings , lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality , all wrapped up in a save-the-earth bow .  but i'm bored with apocalyptic settings .  i understand why so many live-action films employ them ? they're cheap ? but animated films can show anything , so why wallow in an industrial trash heap ?  the action scenes and shoot-em-ups don't satisfy either .  the humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can't bring them to life ( in fact , their efforts merely emphasize what we're missing ) .  aki is especially disappointing ; with her lack of expression and flat delivery , she looks and sound like a brunet version of weena , the eloi girl from 1960's " the time machine . "  drab color choices and aliens that appear to have been created in jell-o molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces .  students of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind " final fantasy : the spirits within , " but i found it sub-par across the board .   " futurama " does more effective battle visuals , the kids in " south park " are far more expressive than these mannequins and any old episode of the contemporary version of " the outer limits " does better doom and gloom sci-fi .  so who needs this ?  not me .  
1 moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you've got to know how to allocate your resources .  every dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers .  in the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him .  in the movies , you end up with films like " spawn " , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors .  jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking .  he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line .  watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages .  but like the lions star , jackie doesn't have anybody to block for him .  almost every cent that's invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills .  this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence .  this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain .   ( chan's first release in this country , " rumble in the bronx " , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . )  heck , jackie doesn't even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist .  in condor , chan plays the same character he's always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu .  jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) .  he is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , " jackie , save us ! " , and misuse firearms .  the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he's more pathetic than evil .  en route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives .  once at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film's centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that's even better than the one in face/off .  this is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions .  ignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain's legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn't he take the key with him ? ) .  don't worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara .  just go see the movie .  operation condor has pretentions of being a " raiders of the lost ark " knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie .  however , you've got to go with what you've got , and what you've got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize .  
0 seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater #3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) .  [theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture]  there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons .  they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation .  watching " flubber " really clinched this idea for me , because it's just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy .  it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story .  the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere .  we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist .  within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is .  phillip's memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer's disease - isn't this rather lowbrow comedy ?  he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids' movie if i ever saw one ) .  we learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he's forgotten .  sara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she'll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) .  but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it's no surprise the major conflicts here are related .  christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip's ideas , but his woman too .  what's worse is that sara actually seems interested in him !  wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day .  one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film .  the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter .  it's obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny .  unfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing .  flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object .  most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip's absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along .  but it's clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse .  all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving , flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that don't fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air .  it's all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes .  during the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , " i think they might be cheating , " to which the referee replies , " there's no rules about jumping too high . "   " predictable " doesn't begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point .  and it's not how terribly contrived the plot is , it's the way it's broken down scene-by-scene , with absolutely no transition .  not only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears .  i'd say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it's almost forgivable when you realize they're talking to nothing and interacting with nothing .  it's safe to say everything that could be bad about " flubber " is .  the only original element the film has is the world's first romance between a machine and a human .  but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you won't .  
0 let's get this one over with as quickly as possible .  if there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming .  but as it is , " godzilla " is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio .  producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch " last year at merienbad " until they can grasp the idea of content and plot .  no amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs .  dracula ) .   " godzilla " opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs .  we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins ) .  well , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature .  later , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor .  in a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word " gojira " ( the japanese name of the famed beast ) .  we are then introduced to dr . nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film ) .  he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population .  he is immediately drafted by the u . s . military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature .  in a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u . s . and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica .  well , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york .  when the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york ) .  the military , with dr . tatopoulos's help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system .  it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr . tatopoulos who snaps the beast's picture .  the monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage .  working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr . totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated ) .  well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant .  needless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster's nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn't dead yet ) .  i sincerely hope that i've completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film .  i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour's wage on this tripe .  everything about " godzilla " reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast .  the script ( and let's be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years " razzie " award .  the dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr . tatopoulos' estranged girlfriend ) and mr . broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) .  the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn't take itself so damn seriously .  but to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind .  no . godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it .  the film is bleak and ugly looking .  taking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth .  everything is ugly and dark .  new york has never looked so inhospitable since " death wish " .  in an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue .  the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica , where dr . tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint .  the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up .  you know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint .  for a scientist , this is very poor observation .  let's look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) :  1 . ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ?

0 the comet-disaster flick is a disaster alright .  directed by tony scott ( top gun ) , it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth .  and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble .  jeez .  after a great opening , in which an american spaceship , plus the city of new york , are completely destroyed by a comet shower , nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy .  they hire the world's best oil driller ( bruce willis ) , and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem .  that's like sending a mouse into a cat carrier , isn't it ?  the action in armageddon are so over the top , nonstop , and too ludicrous for words , i had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a couple of times .  i was not alone .  plus , to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of the actor's talents .  the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots .  the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out-perform deep impact .  producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon .  
1 in tim burton's `sleepy hollow' , there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name .  he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe .  burton's update on washington irving's classic tale of `the legend of sleepy hollow' offers us the mystery of the horseman , when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror .  writer andrew kevin walker ( `seven' ) throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes , but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing , as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine .  as `sleepy hollow' opens , we're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau , who won an oscar in burton's `ed wood' .  landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow , who , on a fateful carriage ride through the forest , is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider .  after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town , constable ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is sent in to investigate .  landlord baltus von tassel ( michael gambon ) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case , and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper ( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken ) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods .  crane is not a man of great superstition , and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets ( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie ) .  first and foremost , `sleepy hollow' is a fun horror film .  as with virtually all burton movies , we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman , who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly .  the horseman f/x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors .  but why did i enjoy `sleepy hollow' as much as i did ?  although enjoyable , it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right . .  it was the light comic touch that burton applied .  the film has the sweetness of a candy apple , usually channeled through depp's wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane , who is no longer a mild-mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities .  this is certainly not the only alteration that's been made .  as the film progresses , it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves .  the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together , because for the audience , it's not an issue we particularly wish to be solved .  it's more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive .  still , we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton's keen eye to capture our attention .  the costuming is exceptional , and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout ( it's recognizable that the script was refined by award-winning playwright tom stoppard ) .  the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many .  a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel's daughter katrina , and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent .  walken , michael gough ( who appeared in burton's `batman' films ) and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles .  i suppose the strengths behind `sleepy hollow' lie within the central trio : director burton , constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy .  all of this is not to be taken seriously , of course .  `sleepy hollow' is a lavish , frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children .  if you've got a decent head on your shoulders , you'll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time .  
0 this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation .  but lo and behold , here comes " switchback , " and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as " kiss the girls " and " i know what you did last summer . "  but " switchback " is an undoubtedly weak genre entry , as the material it covers is old and tired , and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting .   " switchback " opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she's watching .  we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while .  he is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest doesn't keep him from offering pursuit .  lacrosse's most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the local sheriff ( r . lee ermey ) is torn between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man .  in a related aside , former railway worker bob goodall ( danny glover ) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered ( even on the seatbelts ) el dorado .  along the way , he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon ( jared leto ) .  this tangent isn't a random one , as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself .  or is the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about .  in a sense , that's half of the basic problem with " switchback . "  for its first hour , the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator , so we're given little insight into who they are , likely for fear that we'll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction .  but " switchback " then decides to explicitly reveal the killer's identity at its midpoint , and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense .  some of the acting is a burdensome area as well , probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves .  what is danny glover doing here , grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot ?  and dennis quaid ?   ( that monotone -- stop it ! )  ermey is solid in a supporting role that's more interesting than the two leads thrown together , but the charismatic leto ( claire danes' object of affection in " my so-called life " ) is a scene-stealer tried and true .  >from a material standpoint , " switchback " is pretty empty .  but even when first-time director jeb stuart ( who wrote " the fugitive " and " die hard " ) doesn't know what to do , he knows what he wants it to look like -- the movie provides some great visuals .  the set-on-a-train climax looks good ( even though the action is illogical ) , and the beautiful , crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor .  still , that's not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond , and more than the movie's look will end up leaving you cold .  
1 robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people .  in " the natural " ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be " the best there ever was , " but still acted like a humble farm boy .  in " butch cassidy and the sundance kid " ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer .  even in " indecent proposal " ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love .  in his latest film , " the horse whisperer , " based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character .  redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up .  despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase " horse whisperer " to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life .  booker's talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident .  the accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace's friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace's horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg .  annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker .  at first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn't work .  instead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest ) .  in many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically .  the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it's hard not to see annie and grace's leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country .  in " the horse whisperer , " country is clearly the victor .  the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace's anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie's controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people .  redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed " a river runs through it " six years ago .  in many ways , " the horse whisperer " comes from the same poetic vein as " river , " and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains .  but then , that would ruin the magic .  much of the film's photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land .  to further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( " natural born killers , " " platoon " ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio .  in terms of the story itself , " the horse whisperer " gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean's " a brief encounter " ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood's 1995 adaptation of robert james waller's " the bridges of madison county " ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted " bridges " ) .  although " the horse whisperer " has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story .  it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who's being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is .  in " the horse whisperer , " the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill .  he plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him .  he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man .  there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character .  it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap .  as they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him .  it's a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie's thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness .  after all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it .  the best scenes in " the horse whisperer " tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse .  although booker's horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing .  these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true .  at some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more .  nevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film .  there are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow-dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together .  although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make " the horse whisperer " worth the price of admission .  
0 these days , we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old , cult tv shows .  most of the times , the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past .  but , some five or six years ago , there weren't that many movies and the trend didn't look that depressing .  so , the people who , like the author of this review , grew up watching flintstones , popular 1960s animated series about " modern stone age " family , weren't particularly worried when the word came about live action remake .  after all , the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and , if anything else , at least the special effects would be good .  the plot revolves about flintstones , family set in fictious stone age " town " of bedrock , whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america .  fred flinstone ( john goodman ) works in the quarry , and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble ( rick moranis ) and his wife betty ( rosie o'donnell ) to adopt a baby .  to return the favour , barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred , and , based on that , fred gets well-paid job in management .  but , of course , this is just a sham - corrupt official cliff vandercave ( kyle maclachlan ) and his sultry secretary sharon stone ( halle berry ) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme .  in the meantime , fred's wife wilma ( elizabeth perkins ) must face her mother ( elizabeth taylor ) who can't stand fred .  on the superficial level , the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life .  computer effects are flawless , and the costumes , settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show .  unfortunately , problems with this film start with inadequate casting - rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney , while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie o'donnell .  but the greatest problem of all is plot , or to be precise , the lack of plot .  some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame , original characters one-dimensional , and many elements of the story , like embezzlement and inter-office politics , totally incomprehensible for the little children , the main targeted audience of this film .  result is almost unwatchable mess , occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting ( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma ) and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as " high concept " .  after great hype , movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version .  all in all , film isn't that bad , but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it .  
0 synopsis : easily-angered , chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce .  diedre easily cons david's not-so-bright new wife molly into believing she's a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and david's quick-tempered son , michael .  diedre , at the same time , murders a bunch of people .  comments : the ex is a very bad movie .  i haven't seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while .  i kept vacillating , however , between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ( ultimately , i decided to split the difference and give it two stars ) .  as summarized briefly in the synopsis , this is yet another spurned-psycho-lover-gets-her-revenge type movie .  i'm not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline , but it seems like 10 , 000 , 000 , 000 .  the ex , however , though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre , differs slightly from the norm in that , at least , it doesn't take itself too seriously like so many other duds do ( malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind ) .  those involved in the movie realize they're in a turkey , apparently , and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script .  the ex's storyline , as i said , incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature ; however , the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that , after a while , the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie .  diedre , david's first wife , kills and kills and kills , for example , without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like ( it's not as though she's bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime ) .  david and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael , their son , has emotional problems , specifically his inability to control his anger .  though david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie , the connection between him and his son is not made .  molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she's a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son .  time and time again , things do not add up in this movie .  if a viewer can't accept this fact , then he will definately not like the ex .  if , on the other hand , he can appreciate the movie for its campiness , then he'll probably like it much better .  i don't mean to necessarily suggest , however , that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp .  even when viewed from an it's-so-bad-it's-good angle , this movie isn't all that successful .  the ex does have its moments , though , almost all of which involve yancy butler ( the psychotic diedre ) and nick mancuso ( david ) .  these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which , oftentimes , elicit chuckles from the audience .  the truly awful lines written for them help this humor along .  butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue ; every time her character kills someone , she has a punchline that's unbelievably inane .  when she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david , for example , diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states " i'm so sorry , your lease is terminated . "  or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene ?   ( diedre's therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit diedre , alone , in her new apartment -- never realizing , of course , that it's not her's .  therapists typically are catatonically brain-dead in these movies ) .  having successfully snuffed the woman out , diedre looks at the body and says : " what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session , dr . jones ?  oh , that's right .  'i'm sorry , but your time is up ! ' "  this is what passes for humor in the film .  the audience doesn't necessarily laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience can't believe they're watching this crap -- although watching it they are ) .  nick mancuso's chainsmoking , nervous-wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler's character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief .  in between drags off his cigarette , for instance , in one of the movie's best scenes , david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex-wife is .  in exaggerated exasperation , he nearly shouts " the woman is a cuckoo-bird ! "   ( trust me , it is funny in context . )  and so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion .  i won't reveal the ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review ) , but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film .  molly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds !  molly , at one point in the film , not-so-brilliantly observes , after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family's to spy upon them , that " she's crazy . "  you'd be pretty crazy too if you'd rented this turkey .  i'd avoid it unless it's on tv and you come across it .  if you do , you may want to watch it , groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot , and feel good that you didn't spend money renting it .  
0 i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard .  the problem is , i can't remember them as i write this review .  that's not a good sign .  in booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can't really describe , because i don't know that much about him .  i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn't like relationships , just " booty calls " at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment ) .  bunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz's direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! ) .  rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it's going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki's friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) , who have never met .  to make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki's obsession with safe sex .  first she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them .  oh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin .  back to the store .  now they've got to get dental dams , or there'll be no foreplay .  why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ?  nikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she'd better be making these demands , too .  talk about coitus interruptus .  booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies .  the difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality .  in this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane !  at the extreme .  there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention .  it is disappointing , and even worse , distracting .  there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? )  does not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing .  for instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant .  bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone's surprise .  however , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery .  this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene .  if , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , " kung-fu movies , " and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective .  this is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable .  by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit .  the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions .  why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ?  why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ?  if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn't she have some condoms at her own apartment ?  these questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward .  a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language .  some movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character's pattern of speech .  other films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves .  booty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it doesn't work .  they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them .  half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason .  the chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler .  this is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long .  it's too bad that the core of the film isn't much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog .  i refer you to the first paragraph of this review .  
0 sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality .  he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict .  but , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet's reputation .  a stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness , belongs to the latter category .  the heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york .  during one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed .  in order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community .  emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder .  concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover .  that isn't easy , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways .  things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) .  using peter weir's formula isn't the greatest flaw of this film .  even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent .  but the worst insult to viewer's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith .  the author of this review never liked this actress very much , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles .  role of emily eden , unfortunately , isn't one of them .  first of all , she can't pass for tough nypd street fighter , and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn't much better .  screenplay by robert j . avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) .  but , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community .  also , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture .  that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time .  
1 when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time .  while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good .  i'm happy to say that there's something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs .  in fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours .  the film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island .  ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can't seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w .  earl brown ) , who's being harassed by one of the school jocks .  it seems warren's sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted's willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up .  mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom .  ted was just flattered that she even knew his name .  unfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital .  fast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn't seen since that fateful day .  with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love .  however , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections .  there's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin .  not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them .  with their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you'll not only enjoy , but also won't mind talking about the next day at the water cooler .  the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers' last two films ) they almost all work .  i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on .  one minute you'll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you'll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary's apartment .  one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller .  he is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he's a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation .  ted's a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don't always work out .  it's comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top .  actually , i've liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties .  the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money .  in it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler .  it was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived " the ben stiller show " on the fox network in late '92/early '93 .  like " the critic " ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show's cancellation .  cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times .  however , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she's got guys just falling over each other to be with her .  heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week .  my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn't change , and you know , it's really true .  he and ralph macchio must hang out or something .  maybe they live in dick clark's pool house .  anyway , here's another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary's heart .  the supporting performances are also good .  chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy .  lin shae , who plays mary's neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film .  lee evans , as mary's friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist .  the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren't any noticeable times where the film drags .  the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes .  they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera .  it's a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film .  after that it got a little annoying , and it's unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow .  fortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there's something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater .  
0 john boorman's " zardoz " is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own .  not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time .  of course , wood's career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent .  boorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain " zardoz " ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful " exorcist ii : the heretic " ) .  boorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn't know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent .  this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece " deliverance " ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama " hope and glory " ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic " excalibur " ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure " the emerald forest " ( 1985 ) .  his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste .  if boorman is anything , he's ambitious , and when he succeeds , it's in grand fashion .  unfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around .   " zardoz " is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman's .  his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even " the wizard of oz , " a book which figures into the movie's plot .  but , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling .  the events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found .  in fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions .  it's more middle ages than space age .  the world of " zardoz " is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life .  these immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society .  however , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years .  if someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals .  one of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed .  like " the wizard of oz , " he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head .   ( this flying head is one of the movie's opening images , and it's a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . )  calling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can't procreate and take up more resources .  from inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , " the gun is good .  the penis is evil . "  that line alone is worth the movie's cult following .  one day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz's flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex .  once there , the immortals label him a " brutal " and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them .  they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up .  i say " hilarious " because that is exactly what " zardoz " is .  it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn't get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming .  just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker .  boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of " deliverance , " which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort .  he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( " 2001 " ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in " zardoz " besides the inadvertent humor .  sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace .  he got exactly that in " zardoz , " and it's a wonder it didn't end his career .  i'm sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements .  is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ?  is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ?  or is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ?  karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary .  come to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip .  people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy .  
1 an entertaining 2 hours awaits the audience in this film set in the early 80's .  sevigny and beckinsale play disco chicks alice and charlotte , who are on the lookout for love .  alice is mousy , shy , intellectual , charlotte is bitchy , out-going and fun .  we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures , and men , all to the background of the local disco .  whit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story .  alice and charlotte are both well written characters , and the actresses who play them aren't bad aswell .  sevigny delivers an honest performance , and makes the audience feel for her character .  beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified , yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable .  the huge supporting cast also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining .  the dialogue is sharp and well written , with many funny set pieces .  for example , there's a great discussion about lady & the tramp by the main characters .  the disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long film is good fun .  the direction is good , bringing out the drama and comedy in the scenes .  but their are slight flaws with the movie .  firstly , although it is supposedly set in the 80's , the characters are very , very 90's .  the way they dress and act have a very 90's feel to them .  although the male hairstyles look slightly 80's , frankly the 80's atmosphere just wasn't conveyed , which is a shame .  also , as mentioned above , the film is too long , and some parts do lag .  the charm of the characters do help these moments , but generally the editing could of been a bit tighter .  the plot also side-tracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust , which seemed out of place in this movie .  finally , their are almost too many characters in the film , and despite the running time , the film never really spends enough time on them .  some of the characters are very slight , which is a shame .  the conclusion , while funny , is also surprisingly weak , and certainly not strong enough .  but despite these qualms , the last days of disco is a funny , warm movie , which is certainly worth seeing , and is a fitting homage to the disco era of the 80's .  worth a look .  overall rating=  review by david wilcock ? 1998   " you know , for kids " - norville barnes  
1 kadosh means sacred in hebrew .  amos gitai's fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one .  the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic's intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government .  gitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel .  the emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god's law from only the male's view .  that if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are .  the story takes place in jerusalem's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel .  this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief .  it is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go .  the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance .  the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace .  the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god .  he even thanks god that he didn't make him a woman .  his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom .  she looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv .  meir is a talmudic scholar .  his father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva .  he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child .  since the hasidim look upon a woman's role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man's role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage .  she receives an anonymous letter that states " a woman without a child is no better than dead . "  meir's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud .  meir's father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : " a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . "  all the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren .  she will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel .  their religion doesn't permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor .  rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion .  so when meir's father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters .  rivka's spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life .  she has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov .  but , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin .  when yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer .  he now works as a singer in a nightclub .  malka's mother is worried that her daughter won't get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn't love .  yossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a bull-horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies .  the two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage .  the harshest scene in the film is on malka's wedding night .  yossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love .  the sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does .  but the choices are obliterated by one's beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up .  for the sisters , the choices are life or death ones .  gitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close-knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life .  the film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed .  
1 much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of " lolita , " made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it's important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit .  when seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation . . . well ,  you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution .  what's even worse is that seeing this " lolita , " especially the first time and if you're familiar with anything " lolita , " is admittingly very anticlimactic .  this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it's really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : " flashdance , " " fatal attraction , " and " indecent proposal " ) , at least besides " jacob's ladder . "  i've seen this " lolita " twice : the first time , i wasn't so blown away .  it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting .  the second time , not really thinking about how i've waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i'm seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally .  the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it's such a good novel , and why this is such a good film .  the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it's not trash for the perverted but because it's about human obsession with things that are out of one's reach .  its protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies .  the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can't live without .  these ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating .  the focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized .  the tone of the book is a comical one , but it's also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective .  humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed .  we get a sense that perhaps it's by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed .  he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita .  he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her .  the story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace .  the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him .  the opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn't done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ?  this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn't possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general .  in that film , he used the traps of society as benefits .  the studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile . . . and  when you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession .  the censors wouldn't allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through .  looking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we've read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it's really impossible to compare them .  they both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was .  and although it's true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it's unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse .  i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won't say that here .  however , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it .  it doesn't have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had .  some of that is in the casting of the two leads .  jeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert .  he's droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does .  he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience .  and when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he's her prisoner for as long as he lives .  and dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible .  she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character .  it's easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time .  when he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her .  there are two other minor characters in the film , one who's a road block in the beginning , and the other who's a reappearing threat to the relationship .  the former is charlotte , lolita's mother , played by melanie griffith .  in the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish .  and she's the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning .  as played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she's about half of them .  it's annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first .  and even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she's nothing more .  the other is clare quilty , the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita , and succeeds , but at a price .  langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original .  quilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms , popping in states of rambling , german , proning , and eventually drunk .  langella takes the other route , allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed , and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots , and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending , the exact opposite of what we thought of him .  as you can see , most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter , stephen schiff , but just parts of a whole new look at the novel , at least cinema-wise .  this version is beautiful , and perpetually saddening .  the camera movements are stylized , and each shot is breathtakingly rich .  the acting is for the most part wonderful , and when we watch it , we really get a sense that for humbert , who is telling the story , the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita .  more importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it .  by the end , with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car , following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn't regret , we feel that we all lose to something we can never have .  
1 back in 1998 dreamworks unveiled their first computer animated movie " antz " .  the film was critically acclaimed , and went on to gross almost $100m dollars at the domestic box office .  again in 1998 they released their traditional animated film " the prince of egypt " and it named an instant classic , and became a huge hit as well .  on a winning streak , they released " the road to el dorado " and it wasn't as big as they hoped , but still did ok , then they had the fantastic " chicken run " in the summer .  now in 2001 dreamworks has released what i can safely name , one of the top five best animated films .  shrek ( mike myers ) is about a loving , green ogre who lives in the woods of duloc by himself .  surrounded by fairy tale characters , he hopes somehow he would escape from everyone .  the ruler of duloc is the short , heartless lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) , who is offering a reward to all the fairy tale creatures , if they are captured and arrested .  of course many of the owners turn them in for gold and silver , but one of those creatures is donkey ( eddie murphy ) .  a regular donkey , except he talks and has a definite attitude , after his owner tries to disown him , he escapes into the woods , and runs into shrek .  lord farquaad however , has different plans and makes all the fairy tale creatures in the woods near shrek's house .  to get his property back , and his life back shrek must rescue princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) so lord farquaad can be a king .  shrek wants his property back , but he never thought he would fall in love with princess fiona .   " shrek " is such an amazing film , that while watching it you can't help but just smile the entire time and wonder why that other production company can't make movies like this .  the animated graphics are so great , that they look every bit of realistic .  i saw previews for this film all last year , and i thought to myself wow , what a great movie this will be .  i must say i was not disappointed at all , and the film is the best of 2001 so far , and will go down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year .  the voice talents are brilliant as well , with the comic genius mike myers .  in the past he has been a wayne , an austin , and a person married to an ax murderer .  now he is shrek , not only does he do the voice talent . . . but he is shrek .  with his irish accent , and he lovable personality , shrek becomes a friend to the audience and warms your heart .  eddie murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s " mulan " does another bang up job here , and he is the comic relief in the film .  the tones of his voice , the lines he utters , and the jokes he gives , he even outdoes the comic genius of robin williams in " aladdin " .  the always beautiful cameron diaz gives the voice of princess fiona and she does a great job as well .  she is very funny , and her character fits her to a t . of course the best supporting voice is john lithgow , who is personally one of my favorite actors .  he as the bad guy lord farquaad does a great job in being both sinister and funny at the same time .  at times i was so amazed by the computer graphics , that you can't help but just start looking at backgrounds .  there is many hidden jokes in the film , and even reflections of light on the screen like a camera .   " shrek " is a definite kid film , but not just a kid film for it is a film for the entire family to enjoy .  there are many adult jokes in the film that the kids won't get , but the parents will be laughing .  believe me though , everyone will be laughing the entire way through .  in the end , " shrek " gives a very important message to it's audience to enjoy and be who you are .  everybody out there is beautiful in their own way , even though it may be inside .  there's not many words that can praise " shrek " enough , but my words to you is to stop what you are doing and see this movie now .  
1 on april 12th , 1912 , the most astonishing shipwreck in the history of the world occurred .  on that fateful night , the titanic sunk .  now , more than 50 years later , a film has been made .  and what a film that is .  james cameron's newest movie is a landmark in storytelling , emotion , and special effects .  it starts in the present , where bill paxton and his band of scientists explore the depths of the ship's wreckage .  exploring an old chest , paxton comes across a nude drawing of a young woman .  the drawing is televised and the woman ( gloria stuart ) whose portrait the painting is of comes forward and slowly but surely , the ship's story is told .  leonardo dicaprio stars as jack dawson , a young man with a sketch book , a heart of gold , an intelligent mind , and not much else . he wins his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game , and is the perfect match for rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) .  she grows to love jack , but seems unable to escape the slimy clutches of her arranged fiance' , cal hockley ( billy zane ) .  the film takes its time , and by doing so , makes us care about its characters , and shows us the full aspects of human emotion .  the leads shine ; there is no bad performance ; in fact , these do not seems like performances at all , but genuine people , trapped on the doomed vessel , facing certain death .  watching this film , i was amazed at how vivid and real these situations feel : the time rose and jack spend together at a third-class-party ; the naivety that jack feels when he skecthes rose nude ; the terror felt by all onboard , as certain doom turns people into both cowards and heroes .  this , the most expensive movie ever made , $200 million , is destined to make its profit back , and then some .  it also has more emotion and warmth than any other film this year . . even this decade .  it is also yet another first : the first $200 million dollar romance , and every critic in this country will agree that it was indeed , money extremely . . very   . . well  spent .  
1 trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions .  the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike .   ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs . trekker polemic as not worth arguing about . )  the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe .  denise crosby , who played tasha yar on " star trek : the next generation , " serves as the host .  in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed ) .   ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the " new yorker " as the first recorded usage of the word . )  unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans .  one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate .  others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of .  my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams .  arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do .  her claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well .   " every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , " she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession .  she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar .   " i'm an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , " she reminds us .  her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith .  along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty .  and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment .  few other avocations could give this much satisfaction .  these people are having the time of their lives .   ( for the record , i'm not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies . )  the film interviews the various star trek series's stars as well as its fans .  the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade , but over twenty years later , the conventions are still going strong .  filled with anecdotes , the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions .  at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel .  after appearing briefly , he drank some water and left .  they decided to auction off his half-empty glass , joking that it had the " q virus . "  the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too .  with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity .  not just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies .  one guy is a trekkie cross-dresser , another dresses her cat , and then there is the dentist .  the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set .  he , his oral hygienists , his receptionist , his wife , and his kids wear the outfits all of the time .  it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home , but not his family .  for variety , he and his family do change characters from time to time .  he says his patients like it .  well , there was this one complainer , but he had a problem with his bill anyway .  there are summer schools for klingon with ph . d . linguists to teach the language .  hamlet is now available in klingon , albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore , and they are working on translating the bible .  they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs , even u . s . customs .  the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series's larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns .  sandwiched in-between the levity , the switch in tone doesn't work .  the incessantly up-beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator .  he fits right in .  trekkies runs a breezy 1 : 26 .  it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages .  
0 certainly no one would rent ed wood's glen or glenda ?  expecting to see a good movie , but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn't know was possible .  in fact , wood's infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison .  watching glen or glenda ?  i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result , it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious .  the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary , with endless , repetitive narration about transvestites , how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend's clothes without being able to wear them , how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals , and how the main character , glen/glenda is ( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times ) " not half man and half woman , but man and woman at the same time . "  the camera work is terrible-occasionally the camera lingers on , say , a closed door while the characters talk off-screen , or inexplicably zooms in on someone's ear or nose .  wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage , which leads to voiced-over non-sequiturs like , " yes , our world is a busy and frightening place , with so many people driving their automobiles . "  finally , there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein-style laboratory , delivering pointless lines such as , " people .   .   .  all with their own thoughts .   .   .  their own ideas .   .   .   . "  while lightning crackles quasi-ominously overhead .  had wood continued in this vein , glen or glenda ?  probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror-movie touch .  unfortunately , he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script .   " pull the string !  pull the string ! "  announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears .  there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns , this time warning us , " beware .   .   .  beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door !   .   .   .  it eats little boys .   .   .  and puppy dogs' tails .   .   .  and big fat snails ! "  a bizarre nightmare sequence , which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid , ensues , during which glen/glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree-in the living room .  someone who is apparently intended to be the sinister " green dragon " ( but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series ) appears to be orchestrating all this , though the film is far from clear on this point ( to put it kindly ) .  near the end of this scene-and here i must confess that wood lost me completely-is a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music .  after this scene ends ( not a moment too soon ) , glen or glenda ?  returns to its documentary style , but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone .  the film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism , but at that point it didn't matter much what happened .  as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over , glen or glenda ?  had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen .  i honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could , it still might not match glen or glenda ?  for sheer cinematic disaster .  i am giving this movie an f , but i'm not sure that quite does it justice .  
1 the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam .   ( fitting , since the media-saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment . )  while driving through a long , flat iraqi desert ( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament ) , one of the men under special forces sgt .  maj . archie gates' ( who's steering ) command requests a beach boys tune .  these men want their apocalypse now moment , only instead of surfing , they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle , armed with automatic rifles .  our three kings ( okay , four ) are good fighters , but they don't necessarily take operation desert storm seriously-it's a reprieve from their hellish day jobs .  they are gates , new father sgt .  troy barlow ( wahlberg ) , sgt .  chief elgin ( cube ) , and pvt .  conrad vig ( music video director jonze ) .  at story's start , president bush has declared a ceasefire , and american troops are tying up loose ends .  barlow , elgin , and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an " ass-map " that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion .  gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes-demands-that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt .  ditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy .  so is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam's men are threatening the dictator's detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence .  when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help .   ( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause . )  gates convinces the vault's guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck .  the situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges .  but the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces .  the result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime .  barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device .  his interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child .   ( he does , in chilling , lasting images . )  i liked these scenes best , because the political became personal .  it's one thing to champion the plight of thousands ; it's another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib .  russell has shocked us before : his first film , spanking the monkey , is about a young man's affair with his bedridden mother .   ( it's great . )  his second , flirting with disaster , features a character who has an armpit fetish .  one could argue that it's easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions , though ; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no-nonsense about the violence .  when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home , russell mutes the sound-we're paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast .  three kings is russell's first visually arresting picture .  stylistically , it stands apart from other war dramas .  newton thomas sigel's cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy , which is , of course , entirely appropriate .  one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen .   ( a friend enthusiastically added , " it's like having sand in your eyes . " )  this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade .   ( three kings was shot in arizona , california , and mexico . )  russell throws plenty at sigel's camera for it to observe-as was the case with russell's previous efforts , the most absurd moments are also the film's most realistic , even the most poignant .   ( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside . )  if anything , three kings settles down and stops surprising us .  its climax is pure hollywood , no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie-minded russell .  subsequently , the characters become more cartoonish-barlow's post-torture revelry felt phony , and chief , a strong presence in the first third , fails to escape the god-fearing-ultra-serious-anti-racist-black-man-of-power clich ? -so much for cube avoiding token status .   ( the arab players , on the other hand , duck stereotype . )  clooney , too , transforms into a blandly heroic protestor-marching with the rebels , i waited for him to shout , " let my people go ! "  hayseed vig notwithstanding , the protagonists are very intelligent , and self-serving , too ; i had a glimmer of hope , based on russell's filmography , that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture .   ( it's not spoiling much to write that . )  then again , what historical importance would such nastiness serve ?   ( there's already enough cynicism in the film's mentioning of kuwait's oil-infested waters . )  russell offers the masses a primer on the oft-dismissed gulf conflict , and pulled off a neat trick : a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared .  if he set out to make something socially/culturally/politically/globally significant , he succeeded .  with flair .  
0 come on hollywood , surprise me .  stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset .  the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls .  personal , because his niece is one of the victims .  it's a slobbering psychopath , of course , but this time there's a twist .  freeman notes that each of the young women who've disappeared are all strong willed , assertive , and more successful in their careers than the average girl .  we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova , whose aim is to " dominate " these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem .  anyway , one of the women manages to escape ( ashly judd ) and teams up with freeman to . . . well ,  you know the rest .  a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs , with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants , may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story .  perhaps , but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue .  so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further , okay ?  and as for comparisons to seven . . . oh  please !  kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass .  maybe the novel was a stinker to start with , but whatever the case , it's the writing that's clearly at fault here .  one , these characters have very little to say that's engaging or interesting .  two , the script has no sense of humour .  three , while the notion of a psycho's victims being smart , successful women is an interesting twist , the execution isn't even half as good as the idea .  thus , ashly judd comes across all out of focus , instead of being the heart of the story .  we can't feel her rage .  some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she's the no-bullshit 90's type , but these conversations barely register .  and as for freeman , kiss the girls is his second dog in a year : first chain reaction , now this .  for an actor of his calibre , this is most worrying .  young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction-esque things to do in denver when your dead .  but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this ?  not much , and you can hardly blame him .  there's a few well-staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls , dives and jumps , and the effect is startling .  but the script is beyond rescue .  what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe , safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up .  complacency rules : it's been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters , real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue .  the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie , positive proof that the best things in life aren't free . . . .   .  
1 i'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review .  i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson's political satire " wag the dog , " but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it .  quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn't do that .  they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn't quite do that either .  a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick's " dr .  strangelove " in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn't do that .  that said , " wag the dog " is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them .  the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office .  the accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn't particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president's campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood .  brean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor .  as i said , " wag the dog " is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform " we have the right to fight for democracy . "  another scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village .  the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team's attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt .  william " old shoe " schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho .  of course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what's going on and strikes a deal with the president's electoral opponent to report to the media that the " fighting " has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis .  still , even with the cia's involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable .  regardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn't the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ?  the film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt .  schumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it .  there was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss's forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away .  with these plot holes , " wag the dog " doesn't quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place .  brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off .  the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret .  motss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project .  in fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss's increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created .  i think it's fair to say that " wag the dog " underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire .  still , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one .  wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn't even real ?  with this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws .  
1 a big surprise to me .  the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope .  they replaced him just fine .  not with john goodman , he didn't do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing .  the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who's ten .  this was another of my fears for the film , but he's a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed ) .  things that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all .  i'm quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing .  there's a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stops .  it's just the music .  one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway's song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him , but there's no problems with this .  the music is all as good as ever , tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang , who can't sing , all the musicians do a great job .  the only real problems i had was the special effects .  these were superfluous and a waste of money .  since the film isn't doing very well , they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel , which i want to see .  the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide .  -- http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/academy/8034/  remove no spam to reply .

1  " footloose " has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics .  and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it .  the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) .  he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do .  as mentioned at the beginning of this review , " footloose " is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama .  there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate .  so why did i enjoy it so much ?  for one thing , the cast is great .  kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role .  we're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the " rebel without a clue " sort .  yes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be .  and he never broods .  the rest of the cast is equally impressive .  john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian .  but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter .  by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character .  another nice touch is the music .  we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with " sexual innuendos " , but that's not true at all .  the title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun .  during the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing .  of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic .  anyway , " footloose " is a charming little surprise .  don't let the premise prevent you from watching it .  it sucked me in , and it'll do the same to you .  
0 synopsis : wealthy cuban landowner luis ( banderas ) gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride .  not only does his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia ( jolie ) , she also harbours a secret past of dubious merit .  soon , julia has absconded with both luis' fortune and his heart , and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld , luis begins to realise that , for him , there is no turning back .  review : given the absurdism of its would-be plot , it's unlikely that " original sin " could have been turned into a reputable piece of filmmaking , regardless of writer , director or stars .  this is , at its heart , b-movie junk : a lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions .  that said , " original sin " could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it .  instead , cristofer seems to have mistaken this for a serious production , and directs it as such .  the result is a vapid , uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses , as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill .  consider the initial sex scene between banderas and jolie : brightly-lit and mostly filmed from above , it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show .  cristofer doesn't even manage to capture the allure of cuba ; instead of portraying his setting as a steamy , sensuous island paradise , it appears bland and lifeless .  at least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest ; there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script , but aren't being given the chance .  the same cannot be said of jane , whose billy is nebbish and transparent .  also unwise is the jolie framing sequence , which practically gives away the film's denouement .  
0 synopsis : big-breasted and dim-witted sculptress britt gets really mad at her grad student boyfriend because he spends too much time on his thought-transference experiments instead of her art showings .  elderly , evil scientist everett longstreet switches minds with britt's boy , in the meantime , and goes completely mental .  comments : naked souls opens with a naked woman , and the movie makes no illusion that it's a sci-fi vehicle designed to show pamela anderson's , um , talents .  if you are really interested in seeing anderson's talents , however , i suggest you skip over this dud and watch the infamous pam and tommy lee honeymoon sex tape , now available on home video .  at least with that " movie , " you don't have to go through the painful experience of watching pamela try to pronounce multiple syllable words like " eclectic . "  a premise does exist in the movie .  basically , while anderson wears skimpy clothes which barely contain her talents , she practices her art -- brilliantly slapping plaster of paris on naked women .  her boyfriend , meanwhile , spends 20 hours a day in a morgue trying to view the memories of dead prison inmates because this will " make a difference to humanity . "  whatever .  the movie fails to explain how these two hooked up .  be grateful .  after we meet the evil everett longstreet , lots of technobabble and mystical mumbo-jumbo get tossed about , pammy has sex replete with cheesy make-out music , and minds get transferred .  never fear , though , pammy uses her sharp mental abilities ( ahem ) to save her boyfriend in the end .  unfortunately , no one saves the movie .  avoid this would-be sci-fi thriller , unless you're in for a good laugh or two .  
1 director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) .  film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something .  but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story .  so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review .  and when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment .  fincher's the game is no exception to this .  the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time .  fincher hasn't made a film since " seven , " his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever .  so it is about time he made another film .  and what a ride it is .  the game isn't quite as powerful as " seven , " but in some ways it is better .  overall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty .  it walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end .  the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight .  unfortunately , unlike " the usual suspects , " we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false .  however , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent .  the game is told completely from its main character's point of view .  nicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman .  he lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion .  for his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services .   " it will make your life fun again , " his brother promises .  as skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates .  seeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company .  jim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games .   " each game is suited to each person's emotional and psychological needs , " explains feingold .  one day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests .  even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company .  what he doesn't realize is that the game has already begun .  the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas' way .  how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive .  the detail involved in fincher's shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them .  with " seven , " fincher had almost every single shot mean something .  he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to .  compared to " seven , " though , the game is light and comical .  because of this film's sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously .  so don't try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn't want you to .  what does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear .  if taken as it is , the game's ending makes complete sense .  but if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility .  perhaps that is the reason i docked the film .  while trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen .  we don't really care if douglas' character lives or not because it isn't believable .  the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller .  michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas .  douglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance .  his character , who is normally level-headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody .  can he believe the waitress he bumped into ?  what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ?  douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his " falling down " persona ) .  the supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical .  sean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas' brother .  deborah kara unger ( from " crash " ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good .  in fact , she almost steals the film from douglas .  james rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas' predicament .  another good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from " shine " ) as the book editor .  but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life .  the game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs .  what is essential for this film to work is the writing .  john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments .  this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects' did .  however , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot .  and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year's best films .  
1 available for rental - october 12 , 1999  10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play , the taming of the shrew .  that said , drop any pre-conceived notions of what shakespeare's work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsesses over the male penis ; a slightly too hip and racist african-american english teacher ( daryl mitchell ) ; a new kid named cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) ; a model named joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey's crushes ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca's sister - the shrew ( julia stiles in a marvelous performance ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short .  with movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile , it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic-romance .  yet , you must realize that the story is timeless , and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on , groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage .  the first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca's last name : stratford .  their family is run by walter stratford ( pretty woman's larry miller ) , a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly .  in what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor , the family " no dating " policy is amended to " bianca can date . . . when  [katarina] does . "  with prom just ahead , bianca's fate is grim ; unless , of course , she can tame the shrew .  don't think this mission to be a simple one , as bianca kindly points out , her sister " . . . is a particularly hideous breed of loser . "  getting katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing .  when cameron , who likes bianca , learns of her father's new rule , he is quick to consult a friend for advice .  the scheme they dream up is to fully exploit " someone with money . "  in this case , that is joey - the other guy with a crush on bianca .  cameron's friend , a loser by teenage verdict , convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out .  the solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe : patrick verona ( heath ledger ) .  this verona is far from fair ; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison .  moreover , katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that " hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso , hoping to nail his leftovers . "  the laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet .  providing a constant reminder of the fact that this isn't exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy : a party polluted with liquor , a best friend's betrayal , and prom .  it is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy , american pie , never been kissed , carrie , she's all that , and can't hardly wait .  yet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare ; falstaff was a drunk , romeo and juliet met at a party , and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way .  
1 carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven ( robocop ) came together to create the 1990 mega hit that is total recall .  the film is a masterpiece of sets , action , and special effects .  action and science fiction just don't get any better than this !  the story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid ( arnold schwarzenegger ) who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori ( sharon stone ) .  quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice ; a brain implant ( fake memory ) of a two week vacation on mars .  while being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaid's memory has previously been erased .  now the people who did it are after him .  quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead .  the plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action , special effects , and twist after mind-boggling twist .  it grabs you and never lets go !  this film is a winner from beginning to end .  the plot is superb ; combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a rip-roaring saga .  schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever , and the supporting cast is good too .  the action and stunts are terrific .  the sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail .  the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action .  the make-up effects by rob bottin ( the howling , the thing , and robocop ) are top notch , not to mention extremely outlandish .  the visual effects by dream quest ( the abyss ) and industrial light and magic ( star wars trilogy , jurassic park , and terminator 2 ) are phenomenal !  the visuals had such a state of the art " slickness " that they won an oscar .  of course the film isn't always realistic ; it's more fiction than science .  for example , it is true that a body won't explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do .  who cares ?  it's a movie .  movies are supposed to entertain .  and in my opinion this film achieves an entertainment level in film that is so terrific , it may be impossible to beat .  
0 it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire .  usually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein .  to qualify , you'd have to have a modicum of sophistication , so you'd at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel's throat .  but today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy-looking , long-haired , unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you .  by the same token , to be a vampire hunter , one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier , or at least one who retired with honors .  not in these times .  all you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade .  without sounding elitist , the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity .  which brings us to blade , the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which , it seems , half the population is putting the bite on the other half .  not only are there thousands of vampires , but they seem to move from city to city , pay off police departments and , most importantly , establish their own exclusive after-hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower .  with all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims .  you also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry-cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains .  blade , which is based on a marvel comic book character , is , like a comic book , all visual .  the plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader , deacon frost .  it's all hokum and nonsense , of course .  but the filmmakers play it straight .  unfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn't see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings .  you know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter .  another tell-tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero's costume more than the hero .  also it seems it's not enough for today's vampire merely to have fangs .  he must also be proficient in the martial arts .  why a supernatural being , one of the undead , needs such skills is beyond me .   ( of course , this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films-run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires , in which dracula is defeated by seven karate-chopping siblings . )  wesley snipes is buff as blade .  he growls his lines -the few he has - and spends most of the time glowering - as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co-producing this turkey .  blade is just another example of how the vampire film , a once honorable member of the horror family , has gone downhill .  this dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face .  today's vampires lack the panache , the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee .  they are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers' capes .  they are more farcical than frightful .  this whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening .  
0 plot : set in the future , a courier has uploaded some data into a " hard drive " that resides in his head , and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information .  since he overloaded his " hard drive " , he's also racing against the clock before the information seeps into his brain and kills him .  critique : incoherent , boring , one-act drivel with no suspense , horribly unbelievable futuristic environment , bad dialogue , career-defining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending .  it's too bad because the premise of the film was interesting , but unfortunately for my friends and i , this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us .  it's one of those films that makes you start laughing half-way through , when you realize that most of the actors in it suck , the location shots are filmed in dark " junkyard " type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic ( whatever . . . ) , and all the sets look like . . . . well ,  sets .  there is also absolutely no arc to this story .  it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain , and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings .  gibson should stick to writing novels and " x-files " episodes , since his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage .  some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass , henry rollins as a pumped-up cyber-doctor or something , and ice-t as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face ( don't ask ) .  the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghost-lady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point .  i'm ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal , canada , but sadly enough for us all , it was .  some of the cyber-travelling special effects were okay ( hence , the 2/10 ) , but overall , it's one of those bad movies that's just funny to watch and cringe at .  thankfully for keanu , he redeemed his sci-fi career with 1999's the matrix ( 7 . 5/10 ) .  it's too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent .  little known facts about this film and its stars : as of 1999 , director robert longo never directed another full-feature film .  hmmm . . . now  isn't that odd ?   : ) writer william gibson immigrated from the us to canada in 1968 , after being rejected for the draft .  he lived in toronto at first , but since 1972 , has made vancouver his home .  his 1984 novel " neuromancer " and its sequels 1986's " count zero " and 1988's " mona lisa overdrive " are generally considered to be the definitive works of the " cyberpunk " science-fiction sub-genre .  this film garnered keanu reeves a nomination in the " worst actor " category in the 1996 razzie awards .  
1 hilarious , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o'halloran and jeff anderson ) .  they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment .  the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film's budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this .  originally rated nc-17 for language .  not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears .  killing zoe ===========  remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you're halfway to killing zoe , writer/director roger avary's slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery .  eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers .  he's the safecracker who's blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go .  though intriguing on all fronts , the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction , which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino .  in english and french .  the road to wellville =====================  based on the novel by t . coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn't go very far .  bowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr . john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900's , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation .  he also invented the cornflake .  really .  checking-in to kellogg's battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda , just two of the many well-known faces in this failed comedy .  leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack , michael lerner , lara flynn boyle , john neville , and dana carvey .  the art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing , but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama .  what he ends up with is something that i can't print here .  phew !  stargate ========  lawrence of arabia meets star wars .  this epic sci-fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else .  director roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on .  the film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history .  that said , there's still plenty to watch here .  sci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader .  he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that " somebody else " built the pyramids .  less interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame .  star trek generations =====================  trek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best .  the story is interesting , but each scene goes too long .  the cast is earnest , but the direction lacks punch .  and so on .   ( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii . )  original enterprise captain james t . kirk appears on both ends of the story , though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead " get a life . "  remarkably unremarkable .  miracle on 34th street ======================  in a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al , maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street * is * necessary .  john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original .  the romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn't work too well , but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle .  his chemistry with children can moisten any eye .  no claus for alarm .  junior ======  arnold schwarzenegger pregnant ?  sure , billy crystal did it before in rabbit test , but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie .  what should be nothing more than a one-joke premise actually gets better as it goes along .  director ivan reitman ( dave , twins ) wisely keeps the farce to a minimum , so the first hour moves slower than you might expect .  don't expect too many yuks from danny devito , but you can't beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie .  how's * that * for a collision of acting styles ?  
0  " shagadellic ! " , " groovy , baby ! "   " smashing ! "  adorn the 1/4 page ad for this movie tabbed as " the #1 comedy in america " as of may 8th .  did we attend the same movie ? !  at 87 minutes it seemed overlong , like a snl skit on steroids , and at any length it seemed unfunny .  yes , the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s pop frills , and yes , the concept , dealing with a 60s secret agent/pop icon ( played by myers ) awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battle his arch enemy ( dr .  evil , also played by myers ) in the present day , had a great deal of potential .  fun costumes and scenery and potential do not a movie make so lets throw in a hefty dose of bathroom humor .  don't get me wrong , i like a good " bubbles in the bathtub joke " as much as the next person , but to have this type of humor be the funniest thing about your movie is a waste of yuor talent and my money .  but , the way things work these days in the movie business , all a film has to do is call itself the funniest and people will believe it .  i do give this film stars because of the sets , costumes , and sadly , unmet potential .  
1 meteor threat set to blow away all volcanoes & twisters !  summer is here again !  this season could probably be the most ambitious = season this decade with hollywood churning out films like deep impact , = godzilla , the x-files , armageddon , the truman show , all of which has but = one main aim , to rock the box office .  leading the pack this summer is = deep impact , one of the first few film releases from the = spielberg-katzenberg-geffen's dreamworks production company .  following = the rather dismal showing of their previous two releases ; mousehunt and = amistad , deep impact shines with elements which could just make it one = of the biggest movies of the year .  deep impact begins with the discovery of an earth bound comet during a = school astronomy outing by leo beiderman ( elijah wood ) which = subsequently stirred up the political community of the world .  keeping = the information under wraps to prevent widespread panic , president beck = ( morgan freeman ) took it upon himself and his subordinates to execute a = highly secretive space project to destroy the comet before it hits = earth .  while pursuing a sex-scandal story amongst the presidential = ranks , ambitious up and coming reporter , jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) = unfolds the wool that president beck has pulled over the citizens of the = world .  as if the knowledge of the imminent annihilation of mankind is = not enough , jenny has to come to terms with her father ( maximillian = schell ) leaving the mother for a younger woman . =20  president beck announces the discovery and preparations to destroy the = comet exactly one-year later , with so much confidence that it left no = trace of panic within the american community .  achieving fame from = announcement of the comet wolf-beiderman en-route to earth ( the name of = its discoverers ) , leo beiderman continues life in his small town as a = young celebrity .  a team of astronauts , led by the ageing veteran = astronaut spurgeon tanner ( robert duvall ) , was secretly trained to carry = out the mission to land on the comet and create and explosion with a = nuclear device , with the hope of blowing it out of its current path = towards earth .  despite him being the most experienced in the team , the = younger generation of astronauts in the team doubts tanner's ability due = to his age .  but these are just problems of individuals .  life on earth = goes on as any other day , confident that the comet will be destroyed .  when the attempt to avert wolf-beiderman's path failed and caused the = comet to split into two : comet wolf and comet beiderman , the president = unfolds his contingency plan to evacuate part of the population , leaving = the rest to die .  citizens are randomly chosen to live underground for 2 = years prior to impact , when the dust due to the impact around earth have = settled , by then all life on the surface would have died .  jenny and leo = were picked but many of their loved ones were not , only a handful of = earth's population will be saved from destruction .  =20  deep impact's moving moments occur in the least special-effect laced = scenes .  while the effects are fantastic , they only form a small part of = the film , which indulges itself in the development of its main = characters ; leo , lerner and tanner .  leo's struggle when he learns that = his girlfriend is not part of the population to be saved , lerner's = dwindling relationship with her father and her pain for the mother's = loneliness , tanner's strive to gain the respect he deserves from his = crew and his ultimate sacrifice , all form the backbone of deep impact's = moving moments .  deep impact smells suspiciously like the previous year = release contact despite vivid differences .  i think its probably because = they both delve in a story of global proportions and indulges in the = premise of hope , faith and life itself .  both do not depend heavily on = eye-candy in the form of cgi effects .  director mimi leder ( who won = numerous awards directing television series , and made her debut with = peacekeeper last year ) is definitely a director to watch . =20  despite this being the first of the two meteor movies this summer ( the = other being armageddon ) , i think there will be stark differences in the = approach to the subject matter .  while the premise of both may be the = same , execution and focus of the films will in fact show that deep = impact has more focus on human elements than armageddon , which is done = by the team which brought us bad boys , crimson tide and the rock .  =20  deep impact should be able to satisfy a variety of audiences ; from the = most action-craving to those who just want to immerse into its = manipulative but nonetheless dramatic premise .  
0 synopsis : sonny koufax ( adam sandler ) is a rich , childish , angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa ( kristy swanson ) .  in a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin ( jon stewart ) and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian ( cole and dylan sprouse ) while kevin is on an overseas trip .  under sonny's supervision julian soon learns to lie to women , tell people how he " wipes his ass , " throw tantrums , and scream for his " god damned " treats .  self centered , julian breaks a school classmate's arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong .  meanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk , food , toys , and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform .  not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny's incompetent supervision , and this leads to a custody battle .  opinion : it's a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk , and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior .  that's the essence of big daddy .  but there's a bigger issue involved : marketing .  movies that are rated pg and pg-13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below .  on tv , film clips advertise these movies as family-friendly hit comedies .  then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard - - or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment .  folks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff , but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation .  to many american mothers there's probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a woman's " ice cold tits .

1 mars attacks !   ( 1996 ) - c : jack nicholson , glenn close , annette bening , martin short , danny devito , rod steiger , pierce brosnan , sarah jessica parker , michael j . fox , jim brown , pam grier , joe don baker , natalie portman , christina applegate , lisa marie , tom jones .  this is director tim burton's finest film to date .  many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day , but even though the stories are similar , they really are two distinctly different films .  however as a whole , mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4 , and i loved id4 .  you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film .  it is completely wacked-out and unlike anything you've ever seen .  once the silly tone of the film is set , it's easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just don't mix .  the plot is simple : martians invade the earth .  but it's different than any other invasion film .  usually it's the evil aliens versus the heroic humans .  this time however , it's the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans .  the martians , who are all computer generated , are just about the funniest things i've seen in a long time .  they look funny , they move funny , and their " language " is hilarious .  and about the special effects .  the effects in mars attacks !  are just about the most flawless ones i've seen to date .  the computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100% real .  there are just a couple of scenes that don't work , mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship .  also , glenn close overacts tremendously in her ( thankfully ) very limited screen time , so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise .  but there are many big laughs in the film , as i said , if you are in the right mood .  could it have been funnier ?  certainly .  was it funny enough ?  yes .  was i entertained ?  absolutely .  on a personal note , i'd like to thank whomever cast rod steiger ( my favorite actor ) in the film as war-crazy general decker .  finally , after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles , steiger is back on the big screen in a real movie that many people will see .  while he's not given the type of role that you can give a real " performance " in , he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue .  the preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him .  
1 it's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director's cut of the film .  films such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker's integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio .  the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films .  the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson's 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director's cut .  for years , i have heard of an " international " version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years .  i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors' cuts - including l ? on .  but after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it .  until now .  the film follows the story of l ? on , played by jean reno , a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello .  he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12-year-old girl named mathilda - played by then newcomer natalie portman , whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops .  one day , a crew of the cops - lead by gary oldman in an over-the-top performance - kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries .  taking pity on her , l ? on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life .  mathilda learns of l ? on's hit man profession and decides to follow in l ? on's footsteps as a " cleaner . "  she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l ? on he has kept locked away as part of his profession .  at this point , the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in .  the international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l ? on and mathilda , footage that american censors deemed " too explicit . "  i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle .  the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda's and l ? on's motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops .  there's even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean-hugues anglade - star of queen margot , besson's la femme nikita , and killing zoe .  with these additional scenes replaced , l ? on and matilda's relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version .  the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes , the film becomes primarily a heavy , emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film .  the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema .  my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional , throw down twenty bucks , and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece .  director/writer : luc besson producer : luc besson , claude besson starring : jean reno , natalie portman , gary oldman , danny aiello  
0 recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldn't sleep .  he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour .  then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food .  then he took down a volume of shakespeare's work and read it cover to cover - never really paying attention to the words or plot .  and then , as a climax , he took out his video camera and pressed the " on " button .  the result ?  william shakespeare's romeo + juliet - the worst film ever made and a complete failure .  though , to be fair , an interesting complete failure .  the idea at the film's core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds .  this is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we can't see what is going on .  and filming the dialogue in voice over .  and shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model .  and making the frame go still while flashing the character's name at the bottom .  and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion .  i mean , man , this is the 90s , dude .  however i've seen terrible films that are fun to watch .   ( examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau .   ) that rule doesn't apply here .  this is a film that takes itself seriously .  that is it's major fault .  another problem was pointed out by my friend , alex ( who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout .   ) ; the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and didn't take sides .  here it's clear that we are supposed to side with romeo .   ( just look at the way they film him .   ) from the begining he's our hero and this doesn't work .  and dicaprio's awful performance doesn't help .  luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us .  the result is a mess .  you can feel him striving to be something he isn't .  he tries to pull of a mix in which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles .  he tries very hard .  key word : tries .   " oh look , he's filming above water action from below .  pretty .  what does it represent ? "  why do people do ugly things ?  i scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if i could never read the play again and keep a straight face .  
0 if anyone had been able in 1983 to forsee a late-night cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing some of the worst films of the 80's , they'd agree d . c . cab is the quintessential " usa up all nite " movie .  it's one of those childish r-rated movies that kids would love but can't see until it's edited for tv .  it's also one of those pointless , almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs .  and , strike three , it pairs mr . t with gary busey .  i heard gilbert say d . c . cab had " an all-star cast , " but i'm still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in that statement .  when third-billing goes to a two-minute appearance by famed flashdancer irene cara " as herself , " you can't say a damn thing about all-star casts .  likewise for token appearances by marsha " roz " warfield , paul rodriguez and " politically incorrect " host bill maher , before he was somebody .  appearing in d . c . cab pretty much had the opposite effect on everyone else , especially irene " i'm gonna live forever " cara .  d . c . cab is an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher ( who would go on to direct batman forever ) about a bunch of misfits who drive cabs .  you get the feeling if the police academy cadets had made a different career choice , this would be the result , except here you have such interesting characters as the " token white guy " ( busey ) who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world , the token jive talker named tyrone ( charlie barnett ) who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word " honkey " as much as possible , the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chains ( mr . t -- a real stretch for him ) , the aspiring musician waiting for his big break ( maher ) , the mexican gigolo ( rodriguez ) , the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for a living ( warfield ) and the guy who wants to own a cab company for a living ( adam baldwin ) .  we've all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 80's .  some are fun to watch and some are actually funny .  this one is more or less neither .  you'd think plenty of comedic sparks would fly from the assemblage of talent ( whatever ) , but d . c . cab more or less falls flat on a continual basis , culminating in the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin is kidnapped and the other cabbies have to go to rescue him .  it's a shame no one was able to rescue this movie from the depths of stale jokes and unoriginality .  d . c . cab has rightly earned its position on " usa up all nite . "  
1 up until about a year ago , john travolta's career consisted of those " look who's talking " movies ( notice how they never called them look who's talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) .  but somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again .  weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named " size isn't everything " ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) .  but now travolta's back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why .  four words : contract with the devil .  and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich's " contract with america . "  no , satan is much more humane .  anyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld .  how do i know ?  i own the document in question .  amazing what you can buy at those collector's shops for a few hundred dollars , isn't it ?  get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer .  he goes to collect some of the mafia's money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game .  sure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that's beside the point .  palmer is determined to get hackman's next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito .  it doesn't take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from " who's the boss ? "  to speechless .  it works in this case , unlike " who's the boss ? "  although it's interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also .  complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman's other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta's mob boss trying to track him down for defecting .  get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities .  this movie doesn't have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i've seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) .  get shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence .  i'm definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on .  are you getting this , shorty ?  
1 the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster  the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman  the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider .  when those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre .  when the life is that of jeff " the dude " leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of " what'sgoingonaroundhere " .  the marvelous sound of " the stranger " ( sam elliot ) 's voice-over introduces the film .  at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up .  the dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the " laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world " , although he's not so much slothful as he is relaxed .  spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn't have much of a life , but he's having a good time .  when asked what he does for fun , he responds " bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback " .  lebowski's passion is bowling .  when he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him .  arriving home one night , he's beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them .  even worse , they urinate on his rug .  the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife .  his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment .  the " big " lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor .  the next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug .  the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there .  when he's denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor .  on his way out , he runs into lebowski's trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks .  the penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine .  later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny's kidnappers .  this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences .  the kidnappers are impossibly inept .  the dude and his cronies are even worse .  every plan goes awry .  you can almost see lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues .  that's the story , but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter .  there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining .  the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into .  the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they're not quite what they seem .  walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties .  everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam .  when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won't admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet .  donny gets precious few words in between walter's screaming and the dude's rambling .  when he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns .  donny is " out of his league " and doesn't " have a frame of reference " .  the film is peppered with people for whom the term " character " would be an understatement .  the big lebowski's daughter maude , an avant-garde " vaginal " artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin .  the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers .  bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star .  most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler .  as the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose .  the camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with " jesus " ( pronounced with a " j " , not an " h " ) embroidered on the pocket .  he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail .  his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball .  bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has .  i can't think of anyone else who could have done a better job .  buscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly .  the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he's one of the treasures of our time .  it's odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr's television husband .  more like the coen's " raising arizona " than their hit " fargo " , " the big lebowski " demands an open mind and even more open eyes .  a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen , much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss .  there's so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it .  walking out of the theater , i felt that the film had something important to say .  on further examination , i wasn't sure exactly what it was .   " if you meet jesus at the bowling alley , it's not going to be what you expect " ?   " when the going gets weird , the weird go bowling " ?  maybe there's no real message .  perhaps it's just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world .  maybe that's enough .   ( michael redman has written this column for 23 years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about " the man in the iron mask " starring that favorite of 14-year-old girls of all ages .  redman@bvoice . com is the eaddress for estuff . )  
1 note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream .  although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre .  the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes .  the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost .  scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight .  and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion .  it's hard to understate this last point .  mr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) .  indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional " a film by wes craven " drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads " written by kevin williamson " , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented .   ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of " a film by " is attained . )  and , much like mr . tarantino's screenwriting , mr . williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters .  in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels .  scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel .  while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging .  like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the " true life " events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) .  however , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen ) .  there are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical .  flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film .  the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney .  they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded .  the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ?  there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi ) .  any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim .  as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit .  one problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer .  here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery .  the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements .   ( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . )  indeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes .  this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it .  while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences .  they're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch .  it's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown .  in terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) .  their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed .  on the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here .  she doesn't have any compelling presence , and there's nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she's the returning heroine .  given this , and the fact that there's no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal's role isn't nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan's shoes ) , it's no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film .  what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast .  the film's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you've got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel .   ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would've seemed obvious . )  but hey , as rose mcgowan's character said in the first film : " no , please don't kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! "  look what that got her .  
0 the year is barely a week old , and there is already a candidate for the worst of 1997--the relic , a would-be chiller that's more successful at making the audience laugh than scream .  in this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams ( whose last two pictures were dreadful jean-claude van damme vehicles ) , a creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses ( hypothalamii ? ) of humans and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum .  how did this creature come into existence , and why does it feed on hormones ?  the " scientific " explanation cooked up by the four--yes , four--credited screenwriters ( amy holden jones , john raffo , rick jaffa , and amanda silver ) takes " suspension of disbelief " to new heights , even by monster movie standards .  but as cockamamie as the science is in the film , it isn't quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics .  miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination , turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip , complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears .  give it up , penelope--it's a _monster_movie_ .  on the flip side , tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant , but his role is so thankless that it's hard to imagine it being played any more effectively .  it's quite funny to see a film indulge , with the straightest of faces , in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well ( and so recently ) in scream .  for example , in one early scene , a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night .  ok , we all know what's coming , but as if we didn't need any more confirmation , he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away .  everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie .  and later , miller frantically runs out of a museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing .  does she make a beeline for the front door ?  of course not--she runs into the ladies room and cowers in a stall .  with all the cliches , it is only fitting the film's climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film : that of someone outrunning a fireball .  if the relic is truly " the next evolution in terror " as the poster states , then the horror film--and humanity--is in even worse shape than we thought .  
1 when jim henson passed away , he left behind diverse legions of fans and a company whose ultimate success , it now seems , hinged on his input .  jim henson productions and the creature shop are still thriving financially , but as the last two muppet films ( or that silly computer-generated monkey from lost in space ) demonstrate , the thrill and genius are gone .  i'm not sure the dark crystal , made today , would generate from an audience of kids five to fifty the same awe-filled response .  an all-powerful crystal has cracked , causing the leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings : the big , gentle mystics , and the vulture-like skeksis .  the mystics send jen , a naive gelfling boy , on a mission to find the shard that cracked away , which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers , before the great " conjunction " of three suns .  along the way , jen encounters and teams up with the only other gelfling alive , the rebecca demornay-like kira , an ogre-witch named aughra , who removes her eyes to look at things , and a spastic-but-friendly , tumbleweed-like animal named fizzgig .  much of the beauty in the dark crystal , which is a simple tale ( though it does not condescend to any viewer ) , lies in its art direction and creature design .  the puppeteering is phenomenal--observe the scenes in which jen plays his flute , or the landwalker chase--but i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture , a delicately-narrated ( by john baddeley ) , absorbing prologue .  the voice work in the film , by muppet regulars and irregulars , is tone-perfect .  as well , trevor jones' score should not be discounted : it contributes to the film almost as an unseen character .  i suppose , due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature , that it couldn't be helped , but i wish the film was longer .  jen and kira have wonderful . . . well ,  chemistry , and more scenes of them quietly conversing would have been appreciated .  the dark crystal has a very small cult following .  the weaker labyrinth is probably better-known , which is upsetting .  a friend of mine related a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinth's creatures due to the financial failure of people-less the dark crystal .  that film never quite found its footing ; it played like an acid-trip episode of " the muppet show " with david bowie as guest-host , borrowing from tolkien and pandering to tolkien's fan-base .   ( i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of the public . )  the dark crystal deserved ( and still deserves ) a bigger audience .  it's the best kind of children's entertainment : elegant , fantastical , and courageously un-hip .  brian henson , fortunate son , keep looking back at this , your father's masterpiece .  
0 ok , i admit it--i find camp amusement with the spice girls .  yes , the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual " identities , " they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of " girl power . "  but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn't enough to carry their big screen debut , a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world .  the film begins amusingly enough , with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence in which the british quintet-- " scary " ( melanie brown ) , " baby " ( emma bunton ) , " sporty " ( melanie chisolm ) , " ginger " ( geri halliwell ) , and " posh " ( victoria adams ) --are introduced one by one ( to , much to my surprise , excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience ) as they croon the silky ballad " too much " ( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film ) .  a few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film : ( 1 ) the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london's royal albert hall ; ( 2 ) a film producer ( george wendt ) and a screenwriter ( mark mckinney ) pitch various film ideas to the girls' manager , clifford ( richard e . grant ) ; ( 3 ) a documentary film crew follows the girls ; ( 4 ) a pregnant " mate " ( naoki mori ) of the group rapidly approaches her due date ; and ( 5 ) a tabloid publisher ( barry humphries ) attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug ( richard o'brien ) .  capped off by a live rendition of the girls' bouncy hit " say you'll be there , " a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow , right ?  wrong . it's all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches .  i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves , but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them , much less a organized framework for all the " wacky " goings-on .  spice world jumps from vignette to vignette , subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense , at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride .  while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there--during a " dance bootcamp " scene , the girls sing the lyric " we know how we got this far/strength and courage and a wonderbra " --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level .  some gags are just plain pointless , such as roger moore's recurring role as the mysterious chief , who dispenses cryptic , metaphor-heavy advice to clifford .  the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond .  ha ha .  as weak as the script is , i think there's one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves .  the point is not that they can't act ( and , for the record , they really _can't_ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world .  posh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film .  baby's persona ( young innocent ) , to a lesser extent , also works , but the remaining girls' identities are a little harder to flesh out .  there really isn't much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do ) , and , after all , what exactly entails being " ginger " or " scary " ?  apparently , just their wardrobes .  spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices' signature hit , " wannabe . "  the song is as grating as ever , but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much-needed shot in the arm , setting the stage for a wave of self-referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters' film ideas ( the film almost mirrors robert altman's the player in the way the film snails into itself ) .  this section of the film , involving all manner of derring-do involving a speeding bus , is perhaps its most effective , but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher , the documentary crew ) lack a satisfactory payoff .  spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family , and it will please the spice faithful .  but this sloppy enterprise surely won't win them any new fans , which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states .  once the hype disappears , spice world will likely serve as the the spices' final hurrah in america .  
1 albert brooks saves the day , just in the nick of time .  with a very poor summer for movies , brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up , and does so in a positive way .  while this may not be his finest work , " the muse " still shakes up some delightful humor .  in albert brook's latest comedy , he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter ( brooks ) who's losing his edge , as his business partners say .  in desperation , he goes to see his friend jack ( jeff bridges ) , who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past .  he asks jack for some help , and recieves word of a real life muse , that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career .  so brooks seeks the muse named sarah ( sharon stone ) , and is suckered into buying her expensive , food etc . as a sort of payment .  the real punch line however , doesn't come until the end .  it really makes you wonder , how screenwriters really get their ideas , could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street ?  the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner .  speaking of brooks , he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter .  every time he graces the screen , i can't help but start laughing .  albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character .  the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone .  she wasn't likeable at all .  brooks had the right idea with her occupation , but she never pulled through .  in a way , she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak .  luckily brooks could clean up the mess , and cover for stone's mishap .  it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance , because " the muse " had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy .  on a brighter note , andie macdowell was also charming as brook's wife .  she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress , because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she's in .  the funniest moments in " the muse " in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese .  i mean imagine , brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice , like it was something out of the ordinary .  it was just plain hilarious .  it just adds to the satire joke , of how directors get ideas .  brilliant move by brooks .  as i mentioned before , the film is a satire much like it's proceeder bowfinger , which came out a few weeks before .  unlike bowfinger , this is not a mean spirited film that's desperate for jokes , it's rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood .   " bowfinger " had it's moments , but had quite a few problems that were never worked out , but " the muse " still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour .  by the end of the film , you're glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it .  for once i'm not fully disappointed , because the film didn't slow down , it kept moving , even with some flaws .  thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort .  i think he'll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future .  
1 trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi-dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda , the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter .  the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60's , then cut to the harsh reality of the present .  sheffield has become some sort of a semi-slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel-factories ; a once flourishing industry .  gaz ( carlyle ) spends most of his time in the worker's club , a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers .  he and his `plump' friend dave ( addy ) as well as their former foreman gerald ( wilkinson ) have been sitting around the club for months without any `call for duty' .  what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of child-support money to his ex-wife .  suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son , he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild-idea to get the money he desperately requires .  dave and gerald too have problems of their own .  on top of his lack of employment , dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his`plump' appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as 6 months , leaving home for `work' when he was actually a long-standing member of the worker's club .  there we have it ; people with real problems and a not-so-practical solution for them .  gaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag : to perform a strip-act at the local pub .  in gaz's own words while looking at an add for a strip-act featuring hunky `beautiful' men , `if women are willing to pay for this , they sure as well will pay for real-men' .  the full monty is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all .  it is a small film which delves in the harsh-reality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to .  it also is a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of human-factor going for it .  never for once , was it trying to be manipulative at all , the full monty was true to itself all the way .  while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high , audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of a laugh , something lacking in many comedy films ( wannabes ? ) from hollywood .  other than carlyle , who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting , the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on-screen .  however , the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying .  carlyle's work here is a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting , implying real acting skill and flexibility on-screen .  kudos to the people involved in this film , especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your just-another-striptease .  already a critical and financial success for such a small film , the full monty is a humble film which deserves applause throughout .  while titanic managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way , the full monty gives one the same satisfaction ? ? . in  half the time .  
0 to put it bluntly , ed wood would have been proud of this .  a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay .  also , a beautifully anti-climactic ending .  not to say it didn't look intriguing when i saw the previews .  so much for truth in advertising .  roland emmerich , who's later " independence day " would look like " the 400 blows " compared to this , co-writed and directed this inane sci-fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens .  in a useless opening sequence , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it .  it wouldn't be till present day ( '94 ) till they would actually figure it out .  they're decipherer ?  a slightly-neurotic scientist ( nice twist ) , dr . dan jackson ( james spader , doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who's life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word .  why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ?  so there is a hokey ending !  duh !  he figures it out in about a minute .  yea .  and then they get a suicidal colonel or something , " jack " o'neill ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat-top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position ) .  why a suicidal colonel ?  for the ending !  you'll get the hang of this .  they open the stargate , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad .  after an overdone special effects thing , they're . . . inside a goddam pyramid .  so they went to egypt , right ?  wrong .  they're on another planet that was filmed in egypt .  they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra , the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson , with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma ) , and there are fights , explosions and a kiss between two people .  yea .  also melodrama , stupidity , hokey scenes and a bizarre language .  an anti-climactic ending ends with stupid lines ( " say hello to king tut , asswhole ! "  - the quintessential line , lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo-pseudo-pseudo-character development .  by the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i don't know , the " outer limits " or something .  the script's terrible .  the special effects are okay , but nothing great .  the story's so weak that it's almost opaque .  the whole experience just isn't worth it unless you're so bored that you'd consider watching a " full house " marathon . . . or  this .  i'd pick this , obviously , but still , it's just not fun at all .  and i can't wait for it to premier on mst3k .  
1 billed as a " feminist sex fantasy " , this spirited , imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award-winning canadian director cynthia roberts , is destined for extreme reactions .  camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart-felt tale of the title character bubbles galore ( nina hartley ) , a porn-actress-turned-porn-producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence .  however , those in the andrea dworkin camp , will no doubt loathe the film's decidedly pro-porn stance .  political considerations aside , however , this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles' romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers ( shauny sexton ) .  in the backdrop , however is bubbles' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky ( tracy wright ) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss .  this femme-butch-femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity * and * sensuality .  in addition to the romantic aspects of the story , bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex-boyfriend godfrey montana ( daniel macivor ) , a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it .  when his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through , he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her .  these proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence .  god herself - yes , in the world of this film , god , is most definitely a " her " - and a chorus of undulating , scantily-clad angels , have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold , adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction .  this bright , colourful and deliriously sexy film is chock-full of great performances .  making her dramatic debut , after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films , porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary 'straight' actresses to shame .  hartley has overwhelming star power , and one wonders why other non-triple-x producers haven't used her bountiful talents .  it is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of " boogie nights " , a film which takes a far more traditional doom-and-gloom approach to the porn industry .  making a cameo appearance in the role of god , former porn actress annie sprinkle , a true artist in her own right - gives the entire film an earthy , sensual glow and certainly solidifies and , by her very appearance , downright justifies the themes of the movie .  the other performances are equally solid .  daniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role .  shauny sexton , an erotic dancer and pin-up model , makes an impressive screen debut .  overall , bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed .  at one point , the title character declares that " instead of trying to save women from the sex trade , we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work " .  the direction by cynthia roberts is daring and subversive .  roberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straight-ahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avant-garde montage sequences .  the love scenes between the women are especially beautiful .  the musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings , while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70's porn and psychedelia .  amazingly , this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies .  this speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture , as one cannot imagine such an entertaining , original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day .  bubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not , at present , appear to have any traditional distribution in place , so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one .  it's funny , sexy and subversive .  and it shouldn't be missed .  
1 tempe mills cinema , az--this movie had us in non-stop stitches from beginning to end .  all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie .  if you thought they were funny , see the rest of the movie .  it's hilarious .  how does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head-bopping on snl to exactly one song ?  easy .  write an interesting script around tried-and-true ideas , add some good lines and satire , and voil ? , you end up with an excellent , well-done , very entertaining flick .  will and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day .  at night they pursue their life-long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills , ca , the only disco act worth going to .  the only problem , the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door , the roxbury closes , all the while bearing witness to guys with one-hundred-dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss .  the script authors ( steve koren , will ferrell and chris kattan ) cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury .  their flower-shop van is rear-ended by richard grieco , who fears a law-suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star-struck to think about the car accident they just had , but not about getting into the roxbury .  grieco happily takes them in , even introduces them to the owner , which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers ( elisa donovan and gigi rice ) who bet their time and bodies on will and chris .  what follows are some of the best slap-stick dancing routines ever .  the music is superb , and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez's born to be alive .  the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by , for example , the bee gees and their stayin' alive .  it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back , and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump .  one of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will  and chris don't have any mone y , and dump both on the spot , even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away .  an art-imitates-life poke at shallow women .  it's a scene that's an approximate parody of the vinegar's own rolf luedeke's editorial this week national organization for men ( nom ) replaces now .  ted " unabomber "  kaczynski , himself rejected for not having money , will identify well with this scene , if he ever watches the movie .  of course , the script wouldn't be complicated enough without adding molly shannon , the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids , and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good-looking disco blondes ( proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby ) .  nevertheless , will's father wants him to marry molly anyway , but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest-quarter exile .  during the wedding ceremony , will's heart isn't exactly into getting married , and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head-bopping music , will thinks worse of the knot-tieing idea and runs to chris .  definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony .  i found this scene a riot , however , it went over brandi's head -- she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared .  the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries , instead , the step-in buddy/weight-lifter ( who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy ) and who has been lusting for a good-looker for a long time , but ready now to take anyone .  more art-imitates-life stuff -- not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world .  the idiots' mother is played by loni anderson , whose barbie-doll looks  don't play well anymore ( she's a bit old ) , and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down .  i recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in  need of a lot of laughs .  go with a date .  brandi laughed non-stop , as i  did , and a deaf-mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for 105 minutes .  
1 the verdict : spine-chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar-winning performance from kathy bates .  geez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this !  sorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies .  the pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in " absolutely fabulous " ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery .  needless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder's legs !  but despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i've now seen the film a couple of times now , that " hobbling " scene was no less disturbing !  i'm still left screaming at the telly in revulsion !  that may be the most memorable scene , but it's certainly not the only worth watching .  stephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale .  it's a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan ) .  rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer's " number one fan " , he soon becomes her prisoner .  both the script and kathy bates' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? ) .  bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece .  at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary !  this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity .  it's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema .  there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan .  oh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) .  but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show .  along with the pig , of course !  anyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense .  there's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine .  he succeeds , but . . . she  knocks the glass over !  i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well !  in the immortal words of homer j . simpson - " d'oh ! ! "  other nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house .  we cut to annie in her car - she's on her way home . . . he  realises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut  to the car again , she's getting near . . . will he make it ?  ok , so these sequences aren't exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work !  boy , do they work !  if a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it's doing something right !  of course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned " hobbling " !  annie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she's going to stop him once and for all .  cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it !  nasty .  it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho !  and then we're given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i've ever seen .  she gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won't die !  sheldon isn't in terribly good shape either .  if it weren't so gorey it would almost be laughable .  but it's a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked .  misery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller .  the directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem .  wonderful stuff .   ? - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - for more regularly-updated film and tv reviews , check out my site !  http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/bungalow/4960  - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - * -  
1 this is the movie not the perfume .  a slow moving , stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock's vertigo .  it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader , and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader .  set in new orleans , 1959 , it shows the wealthy michael courtland ( cliff robertson ) sitting on top of the world , celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his mansion , as his lovely wife elizabeth ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and young daughter amy ( blackman ) , both look up to him beaming with joy .  his real-estate development partner bob la salle ( john lithgow ) proposes a toast to him and to their prosperous business , while his high society friends give him their best wishes .  upon retiring for the night , his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliver $500 , 000 tomorrow or they will be killed .  inspector brie ( stanley reyes ) comes up with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase exchange , as that will lead them to the kidnappers .  but the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police , taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase , the kidnapper's car explodes and goes over the bridge , where none of the bodies were found .  grieving the loss of his wife and child , the guilt-ridden michael builds them a tomb on the expensive land they were to develop .  sixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on a vacation and he revisits florence , italy , where he met his wife .  when he goes to the church where they met , he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife .  her name is sandra portinari ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and she's working there restoring art that is decaying .  he falls instantly in love with her and doesn't heed bob's warnings that she might be a gold digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her .  sandra becomes his second chance to prove his love , as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him .  the surprises to come weren't really all that surprising , as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson , the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ? ve bujold , and the competent acting of john lithgow .  it plays too much like a rehash of the master's work , to break any new ground , yet it is still thrilling in its own way .  
1 i'm an avid fan of the " alien " saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) .  of course , that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because " alien : resurrection , " the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were .  however , it's a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series .  in short , i had a good time .   " alien : resurrection " leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one .  of course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) .  so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing , but it's becoming a cliche ) .  so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called " the auriga " by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her .  once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film's okay .  also on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it , but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up ) .  there's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it's never really deepened enough .  oh well .  well , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship .  and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who's death is comical yet sad since , well , he's dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth .  of course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old " alien " -brand fun .  the real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there's always a bit of it , most notably in " aliens " with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) .  what's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach .   " alien " is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights .   " aliens " is a wild , tense thriller .   " alien 3 " is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir .   " alien 4 " is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares .  jean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like " das boot " has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat .  the chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there's the most tense surgery scene since " face/off " towards the beginning ) .  and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that .  this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others .  there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed .  one is the aforementioned surgery scene .  another one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome .  the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet's earlier film , " delicatessen " ) .  and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to " goldfinger " ) .  but the best scene in the entire film ( i'm sure i'm not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an " 8 " tatooed on her arm ) .  it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga .  the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters .  however , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there's very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared .  and , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : " who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! "  johner : " well , i can get you off .  but not this ship . " )  the acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in " se7en " who performed the " lust " sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him .  winona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) .  of course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show .  playing a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable .  she's not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for " aliens , " but she's just awesome .  overall , it's a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn't really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment .  the style is the best part of the film , which isn't really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply .  but it's entertaining as hell , and it's definitely fit for the " alien " series .  
1  " . . it's certainly more than just a monster story . . "  - kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein .  kenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale .  the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful .  but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story .  horror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror .  branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches .  his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel .  the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean .  the year is 1794 .  a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters .  his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs .  as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon .  it's a man .  exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew .  his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown .  the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773 .  he is remembering his childhood and youth .  laughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns .  here victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony .  this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed .  like thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother .  shocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death .  standing on his mother's grave he says : " oh mother . . you  did not have to die . . . no one should ever die . . . i  will stop this . . i  promiss . . "  after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career .  after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death .  composing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally .  with strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation .  the result was ugliness .  realizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late .  the creature has escaped .  because of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding .  for a while everything is as it was before his mother's death .  but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously . . .  whale's picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel .  brannagh has more or less done that .  another thing is characters and actors .  branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast .  the greatest performances comes from de niro - the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro .  alone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness .  at first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love .  later when he reads frankenstein's journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge .  he is capable of killing without regret .   " i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground . . . . and  then i slowly crushed his neck . . . and  as i killed him , i saw your face . . "  that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator .  and yet , he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable : " for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all . "  rarely has a cinematic interpretation of " the daemon " approached the level of three-dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel .  another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein .  in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster ( god knows why ! ) with the power of an electrical storm .  almost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel .  here , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene .  branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character .  on the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past .  helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein's surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart .  the rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing .  visually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) .  the spinning camera , the constantly building-up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague-riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley's frankenstein is a wonder to behold .  kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : " . . all  i once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by  my hand . . " .  and the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator's body on fire .  the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness .  and a terrifying last close-up on the creature's smiling face .  can a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ?  to whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ?  shelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them .  following her example , branagh does the same .  his film is a tragic saga about playing god .  victor frankenstein is not an evil man .  he wanted to change the world to the better .  in this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions .  produced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film " dracula " .  in comparison , i can say that " dracula " has visuals that even " frankenstein " can not live up to .  but when it comes to story , characters and casting , " frankenstein " is stronger .  but stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan's " interview with the vampire " .  although the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating .  branagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly's classic novel .  
0 tri-star ; rated r ( language , sexual situations , violence ) ; 87 minutes  director and writer : darren stein  cast : rose mcgowan , rebecca gayheart , judy greer , julie benz , chad christ , ethan erickson , carol kane , pam grier , tatyana m . ali .  review by : geoff berkshire  jawbreaker is the very definition of a " rip-off . "  this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie ( 1976 ) , heathers ( 1989 ) and clueless ( 1995 ) and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich ? s .  along the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own .  the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels , julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel , marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her " foxy " , and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise .  liz is everyone's favorite because she's both beautiful and kind .  liz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning .  in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her .  they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney's car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz's dead body ) .  courtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her .  things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to .  in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into " vylette " , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students .  up until about this point the film is effective enough .  however , an investigation begins into liz's death and the film becomes excessively dull .  the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch .  courtney's plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second .  meanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot .  julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) .  he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid .  fern's rise to popularity is equally lame .  we do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section .  it's a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school's resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him .  it at least provides us with a look at courtney's personality but the way the scene finishes doesn't make any sense .  stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting .  william katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz's distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie's creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman .  at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema's greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer .  the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look .  the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid .  they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color .  director of photography amy vicent , who beautifully lensed eve's bayou ( 1997 ) , does a remarkable job here as well .  shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive .  performances are mostly sub-par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty .  none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress/singer tatyana ali , who has a small role as a cheerleader .  the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like " auto stud , " " college stud , " and " high school stud #2 . "  the soundtrack is decent and imperial teen's catchy " yoo hoo " makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film .  
0 as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood doesn't loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions .  this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) .  they fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges' life by shooting an unarmed pow .  that's against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances .  certainly hodges is not complaining .  years pass .  hodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer .  childers , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould .  because of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops .  childers does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command .  after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd .  more than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down .  childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians .  he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film .  did childers violate authorized u . s . military rules of engagement ?  or are there simply no rules in war ?  the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions .  the murder of 83 " innocent civilians " has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u . s . where is the accusations from the arab leaders ?  where is the u . n . ?  the film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ?  this film ( in a way akin to films such as " a few good men " ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism .  these accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair .  what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking .  one of the earliest apparent problems with 'rules of engagement' is its lack of credibility .  the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed .  a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality .  that is precisely why it's not offensive .  it is completely unobjective .  many stories are started and never finished .  many questions are asked , but never answered .  a lot of parallels are referring to nothing .  it seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film .  is it about arab mentality ?  america's foreign policies ?  america's role in the world ?  corruption in the higher circles ?  it goes on and on .  it consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot .  it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one .  i think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin's probably most acclaimed film was " the exorcist " which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film .  in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film .  though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage .  i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed .  it's obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe .  the characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict .  even the actors can not save this film from going under .  though both jackson and jones act admirably , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this , it is not something that these great actors can boast of .  they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back .  jackson is gray and jones uninteresting .  the rest of the cast , including ben kingsly , blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks .  the time has come for the verdict .  on the charges of complete lack of objectivity , i find this film guilty .  on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking , i find it guilty .  but on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty , because of it's inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere , not only when concerning the arab population .  i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far , portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad-guys .  this is very sad , since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth .  however , it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states .  and that it's not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east , including yemen are on constant maximum alert .  
1 if chris farley had strapped some fake mutton-chop sideburns to each side of his head , spoken with a thick irish accent , and tried his damnedest to play it straight , he wouldn't have been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in " i went down . "  gleeson , who's not dissimilar to the late " saturday night live " alumnus in terms of physical attributes , plays a character named bunny kelly in this delightful irish film .  bunny is sent to county cork to " retrieve " one frank grogan for an irish gangster called tom french ( well dressed like all good gangsters should be and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle ) .  bunny is to accompany git hynes ( peter mcdonald ) , recently released from prison and obligated to tom for disfiguring one of his cronies .  that tom french is a mean bollocks .  he wants frank back .  and a small matter of some ? 25 , 000 that tom's wife was supposed to have given to frank .  for this he won't break anyone's thumbs .  maybe .  inventively and engagingly written by conor mcpherson and directed by paddy breathnach , " i went down " follows the trials and tribulations of git and bunny as they knock around peat bogs , dimly-lit pubs , and seedy hostelries trying to stay alive and out of trouble .  mcdonald is a newcomer and a promising one at that , but gleeson has been in over a dozen movies , most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent on hilarity , " the butcher boy . "  even if you can't comprehend half of what they're saying , gleeson and mcdonald together make " i went down " a trip worth taking .  the film is in many ways reminiscent of another " little " independent feature , 1991's " highway 61 . "  that film , too , was a road movie and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue and humorous situations as mcpherson's tale : whimsical observations on life , carefully-crafted vignettes , deadpan conversational asides , and scenes that'll make you laugh out loud .  witness the episode in which our good-natured protagonists bind frank ( played by peter caffrey ) to a hotel bed , leaving him with only the tv remote for company .  that sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in " highway 61 . "  what's also charming about " i went down " is how the relationship between buddy and git develops .  their trip becomes an education for both of them , but the way it's handled is neither sappy nor labored .  the only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation , via flashbacks , of the relationship between frank and tom .  it's a little too hollywood , and what makes " i went down " so refreshing is the fact that it rarely panders to traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies .  sure it's gritty--make that grubby--but it's also pretty goofy .  although " i went down " emphasizes the comedic elements of dis-organized crime , there are a couple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping with the subject matter .  don't let these deter you , though ; " i went down " is a little gem .  it's only playing at one philadelphia-area theater--and i suspect it won't be there for long--so catch it while you can .  
0 reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) .  the guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : " rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel " ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) .  his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight .  i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , " oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! "  it's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie .  and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ?  auteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's " style " , not the director's that winds up on screen .  kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut " sometimes less is more " .  and his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the " character " . . . grammar  be damned ) .   " how did you know that ? "  the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along .   .   .  since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently .  he's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects .  this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles .  their company's current logo could be " we ride the trends " .  reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head .  although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick .  affleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch .  the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent " serious " movie getting .  it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance )  james frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) .  ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him .  which works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts .  he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino .  though by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i've described might as well be irrelevant .  this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner .  included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) .  though it's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience .  the flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up .  it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau   ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this .  he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart .  problem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play .  character problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off .  the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear .  but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster .  charlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next .  she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this .  gary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat .  these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience .  
0 if you're going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke , why bother releasing it to the general public ?  if you're going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ?  while watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people .  what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation .  celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he's familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows .  allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more .  branagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery .  the usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another .  unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it's not likely that you'll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity .  aside from all the in-jokes , the story falls far short of compelling , and the characters are all empty and lifeless .  branagh proves once again that he's a superb performer , nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly .  the problem is that he's the same character allen always plays , a character who's getting more than a little dull to watch .  i mean , come on , how many times have you seen this guy ?  -- he hates his work , and he can't be satisfied by any one woman , and , at the end of the movie , nothing has been solved .  he brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he's receiving fellatio , and other such stunts ) , so it's pretty hard to care about him .  in addition , isn't allen capable of creating characters who aren't just like him ?  i know he is , but he didn't do it in celebrity .  the vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances .  davis , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry , has a few touching moments , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie .  some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder , especially -- but they're not likable people .  only famke janssen , as a book editor interested in simon's new novel , has any life .  the men in the picture don't do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin , while dicaprio , as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor , is funny but disengaging .  what's really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its " themes " are .  allen seems to think that he's making an insightful movie about the way " normal " people look at celebrities .  the main problem with this is that the character with whom we're supposed to identify , simon , is not a " normal " guy -- he's just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters .  the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic , interesting characters ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue .  in addition , allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( robin , in this scene , says something like , " it's interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ! " ) .  celebrity is arguably allen's biggest misfire to date .  it does have a few good scenes -- theron's super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny , and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two .  but celebrity is a failure at the core , unless allen's point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends .  if he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke , then he succeeded in that .  i , for one , don't enjoy feeling like an outsider .  
1 the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man's life , especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances .  thematically in cinema , love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters ; it is rare , however , for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni's neo-classic drama , life is beautiful .  through a central cast of father , mother , and son , benigni demonstrates the wonderful , undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times .  life * is * beautiful for guido orefice ( roberto benigni , directing himself here for the sixth time in his career ) , an italian jew , master con man , and aspiring waiter extraordinaire .  living in 1930's italy , he lives a carefree life of good fortune ; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora ( nicoletta braschi ) .  although dora is already engaged , guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead ; the two have a child named joshua ( giorgio cantarini ) .  unfortunately for the happy family , the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps .  it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie's theme of family love becomes the strongest .  although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm , he relaxes the role to ensure his son's happiness .  now , instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora , he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right .  benigni's performance is truly a well-rounded one , and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year .  the supports are all strong as well , but the movie truly excels in its script .  life is beautiful is a self-proclaimed fable , one which tells its story in grand , two-part fashion .  in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a " saturday night live " spinoff -- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movie's second half the script's circular nature becomes admirably obvious .  characters make reprise appearances in fine form , and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot's outcome .  in all , fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture , and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see their first " artsy " film .  life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone , and above all is a fine thematic picture .  
1 are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny ?  director/writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film " next stop wonderland " .  the two main characters , alan and erin , spend the entire movie in each other's orbit , catching glimpses of one another , yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion .  is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together ?  does this predestination carry over to all aspects of life ?  as the film starts , erin castleton ( hope davis ) , a melancholy 29- year old late shift nurse , is ending her live-in relationship with her boyfriend ( hoffman ) .  rather , he is ending it with her .  arriving home from work , erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment , car packed with his belongings .  in a fumbling , amusing and self deluding ramble , he instructs erin to watch a videotape he's made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he's leaving .  it's obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand , all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship .  he then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief .  erin's mother ( holland taylor , in a surprisingly effective , small role ) , fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life , takes out a personal ad for erin .  to erin's embarrassed horror , the ad describes her as a " frisky , cultured , carefree professional with a zest for life " .  eventually , erin responds to the tidal wave of responses , which makes for some of the most humorous , telling moments of the movie as she meets prospective suitors and " poseurs " .  alan , a plumber and aspiring marine biologist , first spots erin as he's cleaning the inside glass of a fish tank at the boston aquarium .  wearing a wet suit and goggles , he follows erin from window to window , separated by the glass as erin , oblivious to his gaze , enjoys the fish .  later , we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside , mere feet away .  the movie spends it's entirety having their paths circle each other without crossing .  there are several subplots involving alan .  one concerns his attempts to get on the job track at the boston aquarium , thereby escaping his apparent fate to carry on the family plumbing business .  another subplot involves his father's desperate attempts to force fate's hand by gambling away his life at the dog track .  a distracting focus is put on alan's debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off .  the movie tries too hard to make alan a likable guy .  thankfully , his dream- guy persona is counterbalanced by erin's distant , yet fundamentally hopeful , personality .  the film moves along at an unhurried pace , albeit too much so in the latter third , as we wait for the two to meet .  co-writers anderson and lyn vaus throw a couple of possible red herrings into the mix as the two find other possible relationships .  the films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over .  when alan and erin eventually do meet , we see that perhaps they both were destined for each other as they share a lingering , almost subliminally knowing , gaze .  it's a sweet , measured moment .  the disappointment comes in the fact that we've come to know the pair , yet we don't get to view their impending romance .  the film's inherent belief in the subtle persistence of fate and the wonder it can bring to one's life makes " next stop wonderland " a quiet pleasure in a cinematic landscape littered with explosions , shallow characters and overdone special effects .  
1 natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree .  both films glamorize " outlaws , " in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers .  both relate the story of a couple liberated by love .  but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant .  where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological .  what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores .  what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill .  to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields .  for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed .  this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity .  brahma created .  vishnu preserved .  and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma .  the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics .  your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers .  i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena .  muslims kill christians .  hindus kill muslims .  christians kill pagans .  jews kill christians , etc . you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged .  religion is an orgy of killing .  the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable .   " the state is the divine idea upon earth , " hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc .  well , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ?  let me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex .  consider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever .  god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc . they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other .  during the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power .   ( parenthetically , witness plato as well .  in the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime .  not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . )  catholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil .  it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure .  masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution .  this is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence .  as further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters .  our culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years .  we can't help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self .  mickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves .  it is a straightforward liberation through sex .  as some good patriarch once observed , " you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . "  m&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions .  they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions .   " the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , " as mickey says .  as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face .  we are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is .   " neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans " : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us .  beyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness . . . .  we have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth .  who else has found it ? --the  man of today ? -- " i  don't know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn't know either the way out or the way in " --so sighs the man of today . . . .  this is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay .  this tolerance and largeur of the heart that " forgives " everything because it " understands " everything is a sirocco to us .  rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds !  as far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say .  its alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure .  for example wayne gayle's first report ends with some gen x dude saying , " if i were a mass murderer i'd be mickey and mallory , " in his most excellent bill and ted voice .  on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes .  it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he'd be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it .  let me exemplify what i've been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her " the worst fuckin' head i've ever had in my life ! ! ! "  now , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn't , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this .  sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever .  it's no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey .  as the attendant approached he took on mickey's character in the eyes of mallory .  she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory .  upon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else .  the style of the movie is a whole 'nother matter that i won't get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power .  let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle .  the rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood .  also , jungian archetypes abound .  these can't help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames .  some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) :  mickey to mallory : " one of these days i'm gonna be cummin' for you , " in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off .  semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come .  at the time they haven't yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet .  the two of course go hand in hand .  for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs .  mickey during his marriage to mallory : " as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife . "  the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too .  it reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones .  this is what mickey means by " creator of my universe , " he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes .  it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears .  scagnetti's first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant's mouth .  the indian sage releasing mallory's father , who was reincarnated as a snake : " old man , go be a snake , " after telling his " snake story " that ends with " bitch , you knew i was a snake . "  after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , " you killed life ! ! ! "  this is another telling quote because it implies they didn't see themselves as killers of life .  then what were they killing up to that time ?  in some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were .  in other cases , all the anti-life forces , the cops and their parents .  the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison .  it of course symbolizes rebirth .  dr . emil reingold , as portrayed by steven wright , passing judgement on m&m : " mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong , they just don't give a damn . "  this is reminiscent of nietzsche's whole philosophy , and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil .  mickey : " the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers . "  mickey ( again in his interview ) : " me and you , we are not the same species . "  notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control .  mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang .  the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader , no matter who it is .  mickey : how ya feelin' ?  wayne : fucking great !  mickey : you got the feelin' ?  wayne : i'm alive .  i'm alive for the first fuckin' time !  what an incredible transformation this is .  he got the feeling and he couldn't contain himself .  what a feeling .  that feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe .  mickey when almost caught in a dead end , " think , think , think , think . "  go figure it out .  dwight ( tommy lee jones ) in general , because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film .  his whole attitude can be summed up with , " destroy them ! ! ! "  
1 bob the happy bastard's quickie review :  the mummy  brendan fraser's stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . .  fraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) .  it's a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in .  but who cares , the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can't get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon .  fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground .  basically , it's a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress .  his plan- wake back up and wake her up also , making him invincible .  of course , fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising's kevin j . o'connor ) and some " americans " . . . and  guess what ?  yup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc .  fire flies from the sky , flesh-eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep's plan begins to unfold .  ok , so it's not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough .  the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz isn't half bad either .  the action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well .  no , it's no phantom menace beater , but if you're looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season , you won't find a better film under wraps than the mummy .  if this doesn't give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will .  
0 as you should know , this summer has been less than memorable .  with a total of 4 decent films , it's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing .  with that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on " the 13th warrior " will be .  the film is based on the michael crichton " eaters of the dead " , in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king .  after tarveling for many months , he comes across a gang of norsemen , who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog .  so , they start picking men , and are left without 1 , thus ahmed is choosen .  so far it sounds interesting right ?  not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes .  after that , they basically run around killing .  that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film , because once your story is introduced , you have the rest of the film to start developing it .  obviously that's not the case here .  even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure , you will be disappointed .  since all the action takes place in fog , it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances , and to poor camera work .  can't the camera men sit still ?  i'd like to actually watch a film in focus , but again , they failed to deliver that as well .  the film moves on and on until the point , where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you're eating .  with corny dialogue , that the characters laugh at for some odd reason , a script that goes nowhere , dull action sequences , a predictable ending , and worst of all weak characters , there's basically nothing to like here , except for maybe the set designs .  that's the only thing that honestly caught my interest .  when i heard that john mctiernan , the director , wanted his name kept out of the project , that made me wonder why ?  well now i know .  crichton's greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product , which led to a big arguement .  what's there to argue about anyway ?  the film couldn't be saved , no matter how much they spent or casted .  seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money , i wouldn't be surprised to see " the 13th warrior " become a hit .  please do me a favor and save your money at all costs , or else you will be lost in the fog , like the film itself .  
1 the idea at the center of the devil's advocate , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best films of 1997 , is that no matter what decision is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- " the last humanist " .  he appears in many guises , and seduces many men and women -- in his own words , " vanity -- by far my favorite sin " .  al pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( " lemme givya a piece o' inside wisdom on god . . . " , " i have a million names . . . " ) , as john milton -- the devil .  the main idea -- that he can appear as anyone , in any form ( in this case , a buisness man ) , harkens mainly back to terry gilliam's the time bandits .  but the film , is something else , something original .  part of what makes it so very good , is that it never takes itself too seriously -- it dabbles with morality , vanity , death , and child abuse , but doesn't try to become any profound study of power .  this is a marvelous confection -- cocky , funny , thought provoking .  it is also entertaining .  there is no way you could possibly predict the ending -- it pulls back upon itself , drawing purely out of the mind's eye .  the final shot is more creative , more daring , more challenging , then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen's fargo .  the central themes are fascinating ( sometimes reminiscent of james' the turn of the screw , and oates' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly ) , and the product that is built around it really wows .  its nice to know that things like this are still being made .  
1 it was a crazy time in france , what with the french revolution right around the corner .  king louis xv would soon die , and his son would become king louis xvi .  such is the setting for beaumarchais : the scoundrel about the controversial playwright , spy and playboy pierre-augustin caron de beaumarchais .  beaumarchais was the author of the plays , " the barber of seville " and " the marriage of figaro . "  today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas , but , back in 1773 when the movie takes place , they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once .  the movie beaumarchais : the scoundrel takes a light-hearted approach to its subject , resulting in an inviting motion picture .  one of france's most expensive productions ever , the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year .  now in theatrical release in the united states , it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story .  the secret of the film's success , other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzac's costumes , has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais .  with his glistening eyes and his infectious smile , he mesmerizes the camera and the audience .  his wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning .  in a land where court intrigue determines one's destiny , constant scheming was a way of life for the aristocracy .  as our story starts , we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself a judgeship .  into his court comes a member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight .  beaumarchais , who has been having an affair with the man's wife , makes him wait until the current case on the docket is decided .  that over with , the fight is on .  with luchini's charisma , it is hard to root for anyone other than him .  audiences may remember him from the marvelous colonel chabert , in which he played the attorney .  although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin , played by manuel blanc , he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style .  michael epp's warm and intimate cinematography provides a nice accompaniment to jean-marc kerdelhue's lush but realistic looking sets .  jean-claude petit's music , especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos , make for an enchanting time at the movies .  director jean-claude brisville , who wrote the script along with edouard molinaro , fleshed out a play by sacha guitry which , according to the press notes , was just a series of historic vignettes .  the disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie , but the actors smooth it over with their good-hearted style .  typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in which a rotund benjamin franklin appears in a large pot of hot water , taking his bath .  one episode has beaumarchais working with a renegade spy who may or may not be a man .  another has beaumarchais using his personal fortune to aid the american revolution .  all of this may sound like a dull historical drama , but it is anything but .  the story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts .  the radiantly lovely sandrine kiberlain plays marie-therese , the real love of beaumarchais's life .  but he is so likable that members of the audience may want to compete with her for him .  still , with his beguiling smile , one can never quite be sure if you should trust him .  the movie , on the other hand , can be trusted to deliver a high old time .  beaumarchais : the scoundrel runs 1 : 41 .  it is in french with english subtitles .  the film is not rated but would be an r for some nudity and sex , and should be fine for most teenagers .  
1 first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series .  i have nothing against it particularly , i just don't happen to watch it .  having said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well .  for us non-fans , there's nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things .  the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c .  two proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside .  the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien .  the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze .  we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail .  a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas .  on a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn't you know it , he turns out to be right .  the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse .  five people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head .  the two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made .  their search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to " the truth . "  the plot , and " the truth , " are uninspired .  i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me .  it didn't .  the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them .  but the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden .  it's a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that " truth " too high .  if this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring .  but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it .  the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest .  before the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth .  the locations are not all computer-generated sets , either .  there are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . )  make this fantastic film feel more real .  ward russell's cinematography is very good .  the overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film's plot .  russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding .  when the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed .  finally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train .  i don't know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great .  the movie's soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film . ( skip  to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound .  in one of the movie's most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees .  the visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound .  there was no question as to who the movie's stars would be .  even so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination .  both are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy .  there is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship .  they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street .  there might be some romantic interest , but for now they're more interested in their environs than they are in each other .  no single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular .  but enough things were done right that the x-files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along .  
1 i'm not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius .  when tim burton's twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it's breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure .  and when it doesn't work , it's just dull .  i'm not even sure it works more often than it doesn't , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks !  is brilliant .  mars attacks !  is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer's independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas .  but unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks !  has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it .  the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks !  portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are .  the title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation .  the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman's thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping .  it's so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing .  the movie lays low for the next 40 minutes .  we get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple-sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming .  but mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton .  it's a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton's just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars .  anyone who comes to mars attacks !  expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses .  jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer . rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr . strangelove's buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house's " kennedy room , " a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big-haired , pointy-breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it's made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy .  sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j . fox is her newsman husband .  the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , " they blew up congress ! "  and plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace .  jim brown and tom jones are the film's vegas-based heroes , and director barbet schroeder ( reversal of fortune ) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president .  also on hand and underutilized are annette bening , pierce brosnan , pam grier , lukas haas and natalie portman ( the latter two also show up in woody allen's everyone says i love you ) .  the real stars , of course , are the computer-generated martians , and they're fantastic .  with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull-faces , round egg-eyes with red pupils darting this way and that , these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate -- joe dante's gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory , but burton's little monsters are more inventive .  the film's raison d'etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans .  the sheer level of mayhem is staggering , especially when the aliens make their first attack , blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons .  parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg-13 rating -- it's earned .  the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy , and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day , although mars attacks !  was in production long before that film's release .  cinematographer peter suschitzky , who makes the most of wynn thomas's wildly imaginative production design ( thomas helped define the spike lee style ) , actually took time off from his mars attacks !  regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg .  cronenberg's movie will almost certainly be more somber -- it won't be released in the u . s . until early next year -- but mars attacks !  is surely a similarly elegant nightmare .  this is not a nice movie .   ( and which studio executive was duped into giving burton $70 million to make it ? )  by setting the film's final scenes in the nearly empty , holocaust-ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided , burton's invasion epic suggests that the world we've got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead .  the victims of his invasion are naive , greedy , or disastrously self-absorbed -- and a good thing , too , since the movie's wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish-fulfillment fantasy .  the surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers , who triumph by determining that the alien invaders -- the ultimate elitists -- are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture .  ultimately , this messy masterpiece is the year's funniest comedy and a weird , winking affirmation of the power of the people .  
0 in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black .  sir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner .  his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake .  the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes .  hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts .  whichever one you like , dear , he says .  and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries .  i liked that scene for two reasons .  first , the cakes looked really cool .  second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act .  meet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot .  it's easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it's even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) .  the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess .  i know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy .  case in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie .  however , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani .   ( it's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . )  it shouldn't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt .  and indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished .  well , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous .  so , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately .  anyway , the deceased lawyer's body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role .  the idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world .  if this weren't hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn't know how to act in our society .  it also doesn't help that the character of death is written so inconsistently .  he claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) .  he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois .  he knows everything about some characters , nothing about others .  and as played by brad pitt , he's not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he's just there .  it's as if someone told pitt , " never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . "  it's as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie .  i've used the phrase " angel of death " in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt's performance with this year's best angel performance , nicolas cage's in city of angels .  where pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows .  where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant .  cage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani's character is so shallow that she can't see beyond pitt's good looks .  the movie's other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn't save meet joe black .  sir anthony hopkins isn't given much better material to work with , unfortunately .  he plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood .   ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins's character more realistically evil . )  hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world .  of course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder .  but i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire .  hopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation .  fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i'm sure .  i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i'm asking myself why .  movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i'm going to do now .  go spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap .  don't go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .  -- curtis edmonds   " no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it .

0 note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  it's rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor's first feature film , dream with the fishes , when the plodding , tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup .  any hopeful expectations , however , are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched-buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film's latter half .  the film's central characters are terry ( david arquette ) , a depressed , lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident , and nick ( brad hunt ) , a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill .  nick lives in the apartment building across from terry , who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz ( kathryn erbe ) with his trusty set of binoculars , but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half-drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge , unconvincingly vowing suicide .  nick casually asks for terry's wristwatch , and eventually cons terry into a trade - the watch for a bottle of pills .  of course , terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects , and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch .  learning of nick's condition ( he only has a handful of weeks left ) , terry's compassion kicks in , and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement - terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick's lifelong fantasies , and nick will fulfill terry's death wish by killing him .  this is a promising premise , and mr . taylor's film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point , but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters ( terry is a repessed , mournful character who wants to die , while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live ) and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits , and where the straight-laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character .  this is by-the-numbers plotting , buddy movie/road movie redux .  however , dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline , but by the characters which carry the story - it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic , if not likeable .  unfortunately , that is not the case here , where both of the film's leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying , giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights , and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits .  far from a romp , this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt , and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond .  mr . taylor's dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes - while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone , it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived ( witness such lines as " you should have asked something more interesting , like 'do you enjoy the pain ? '  - see , that's provocative , leaves room for further questions . " )  the film enjoys a few inspired moments - the urn scene , a session of nude bowling , the policeman joining in on terry and nick's acid trip - but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between , and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes .  this occurs particularly often during the film's opening sequence - as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital , i'm realising that this is * intended * to be funny , although nary a smile crept upon my lips - which is probably due to the obvious fact that it's painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts , sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick's scheme of tricking him ; this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes .  the entire sequence is , then , clearly an exercise for character exposition , with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability .  among the cast , coming off best is david arquette , the current master in the portrayal of meek , squirming , stammering fresh-faced characters - he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang's swimming with sharks - who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry .  mr . taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique , where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated , as opposed to a bright , crisp look for the smalltown scenes .  the charge of dream with the fishes's protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me ; i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters , and indeed , in many cases have i been in the minority , supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult , audience-unfriendly nature of their characters .  for dream with the fishes , though , i did find myself on the flip side of coin , often hoping that the film would quickly conclude , and that the nick character would just hurry up and die .  
1 sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest .  some people call it " original " or " artsy " or " abstract " .  some people simply call it " trash " .  a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings .  definitely a generation-x aimed movie , a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke-based musical dream sequence .  whew !  anyone in their 30's or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film .  it's somewhat silly , it's somewhat outrageous , and it's definitely not your typical romance story , but for the right audience , it works .  a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting .  well sorry folks , but i haven't seen trainspotting so i can't really compare .  whether that works in this film's favor or not is beyond me .  but i do know this : ewan mcgregor , whom i had never had the pleasure of watching , definitely charmed me .  he was great !  cameron diaz's character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp .  the audience may find it difficult to care about her , thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him .  misguided ?  you bet .  loveable ?  you bet .  a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city , utah .  this was just one more thing i didn't know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke .  maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise , but i think even if i had known , i would have been just as happy .  a life less ordinary is quirky , eccentric , and downright charming !  not for everyone , but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies .  
1 until i saw the night of the hunter , it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie .  forget the others and the deep end ( which veered toward strained dramatics ) , the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i've seen so far this year .  even though the movie is nearly 50 years old and there's a not drop of blood to be seen .  luckily , the night of the hunter , charles laughton's first and final directing gig , has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re-released in october 2001 .  so , there's still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place .  robert mitchum stars as harry powell , a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash .  his newest target is young mother willa harper ( shelley winters ) , whose murderer husband ben ( peter graves ) has hidden $10 , 000 somewhere .  powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs . harper after he's released and ben is hanged .  but finding the money isn't easy for powell , who must contend with his stepchildren ( billy chapin and sally jane bruce ) , who know where the money is , but aren't telling .  the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments , thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time .  how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies ?  what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin ?   ( no , i'm not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem . )  yes , there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter .  powell's " love " and " hate " knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing ( remember radio raheem ? ) .  and powell's black suit , with black tie and white shirt , could have shaped quentin tarantino's early visual style .  seeing the night of the hunter for the first time , i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact .  you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club .  he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears .  he's like the senior class president with an evil streak .  if i ever need to stay awake , i'll just picture him crooning , " leaning . . .  leaning . . . . "  any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah .  and credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez , who create a series of haunting , surreal shadowy images over the rural depression-era backdrop .  it's a testament to both men that they're able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline ( kids harassed by evil guardians ) by sticking to the old maxim that we're more scared by what we don't see .  screenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters : the drunk birdie ( james gleason ) who's haunted by his wife , and the spoons ( evelyn varden and walt spoon ) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act .  the only lapse is the movie's third act , when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly , bible-reading mrs . cooper ( lillian gish ) .  her showdown with powell is memorable -- a battle done with dueling hymns .  however , the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone , but it's still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun .  do yourself favor and don't miss this if it comes to a nearby theater .  note : a series of revealing , but overlong , outtakes preceded the movie .  the highlights included the legendary laughton ( who sounds eerily like mr . pitt from seinfeld ) running winters' lines with mitchum , and the adorable , tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile .  hours more of such footage exists , as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling .  screened as part of the 2001 new york film festival retrospectives ( feature story coming soon ) .  
0 upon first viewing of this movie , the phrases " been there " and " done that " come quickly to mind .  spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films , the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series .  stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry , but only when you steal the right stuff .  what little plot there is involves dick steele , aka .  agent wd-40 ( leslie nielsen ) trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith .  along the way to it goal ( goal ? ) , the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films , but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act .  the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny , or at the least , satirical .  spy hard achieves neither , as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films .  the " dick , the world is in danger .  what is it ?  well , it's a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun . .   ( i'm paraphrasing ) " type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film , each time getting progressively less funny .  what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother's films while writing their own dialogue .  director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors ( especially nielsen , who can do this quite well ) than on the delivery and context of their lines , much of the time cutting the punchline short .  the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over , as is evident in the final sequence , where there is no comedic denouement after the climax .  as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard , the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context .  one of the more amusing was , " captain of the enterprise . . . . . . james  t . kirk " .  overall , i thought this was a very weak effort .  while all of the right films to spoof were chosen , they used none of the right spoofing methods .  next time they should " spy " a little bit harder .   * * * * = excellent .  one of a kind .  must see .   * * * = entertaining .  worth the price of admission .   * * = fair .  nothing much special .   * = what were they thinking ? ?  
1 synopsis : as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces , a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case .  if she can survive the demanding s . e . a . l .  training , she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps .  throw in a lot of political machinations , sabotage , brutality , water and sand and you have an entertaining movie .  review : the title of this movie turned me off at first .  i mean 'gi jane ? ' ? ? ? ? ?  the other titles which were considered were more promising - in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as i'm concerned .  i went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor .  to my surprise i really enjoyed the movie .  moore as lieutenant jordan o'neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men .  the storyline is simple .  anne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless , machiavellian politician with an agenda to push .  using feminism to achieve political mileage , she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s . e . a . l .  training .  jordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all - looks , brains and strength .  the training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch .  nonetheless , it's one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless hero/heroine along in his/her endeavours .  sure , there are the stereotypical elements - inhuman treatment , sexual innuendo , resentful peers , pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer .  stepping away from the stereotypes though , viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer .  his character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character .  jordan's boyfriend royce is also in the military .  although they both started at the same time , due to the fact that he has seen active service , he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has .  royce ( what is his surname ?  do we care ? )  almost resents jordan's attempts to advance herself , although he quickly settles down to being doe-eyed and supportive .  his character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you don't have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military .  in parts , this is a very silly movie , with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that it's hard not to cringe .  i still liked it though .  weaknesses in the script aside , this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood .  as we watch jordan's battle , it's increasingly clear that it is a personal battle .  this is an individual's fight for self-advancement .  we don't have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings , we don't have to feel uncomfortable because we're having ideology thrust down our throats .  it's enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not .  
1 to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan is a whole new world .  the mouse factory's latest feature is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters .  mulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn't seeking her prince charming ,  mulan's motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say .  the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation .  the emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation .  mulan's crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place .  mulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery .  yet , despite the grim backdrop of war , it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy .  the movie utilizes a strong corps of asian-american talent as the voices for the main characters , including the wonderful ming-na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b . d .  wong as shang , mulan's commanding officer and later love interest , pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon-tek oh as mulan's proud , but loving father .  also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon , sent by mulan's ancestors to watch over and help the young woman .  his fast , wise-cracking , hip-talking mushu may seem out of place , but it's a crowd pleasing performance , especially for the youngsters .  the movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks , but mulan's are winners .  the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot .  the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus .  mulan is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame .  at about 85 minutes , mulan moves rapidly , and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end .  mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain .  also , it is hoped that the success of mulan , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian-american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production .  it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them .  committed to lifelong learning through effective communication  
0  " alcohol and drugs = bad .  not alcohol and drugs = good .  got it ? "  just when you though you've seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen , be that insanity or alcoholism , hollywood releases yet another one of those 'deep , emotional stories about finding yourself' . .  '28 days' is practically a visualization of the usual 'meaningful' true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa-meetings .  gwennie ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol .  for her life was a big party , with no beginning and no end .  this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself .  her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes .  such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west ) , borrowed her sister's ( elizabeth perkins ) wedding limo and crashed it into someone's house .  this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court-ordered rehab .  here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption , willpower and commitment .  most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party .  the film itself feels like a rehab program , whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times .  it is a classic cautionary tale .  an echo .  a big , fat and expensive clich ? .  a shadow of last year's 'girl , interrupted' , which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like 'the cuckoo's nest' and 'trainspotting' .  director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors , that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review .  for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama/comedy .  jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues : alienation , despair , terror , confusion , loneliness .  and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean .  isn't that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place ?  even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park . betty thomas' idea of hell is a cozy , homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke , drink or watch tv after 11 .  it is simply too light , simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously .  but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance .  that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story .   " all you need to do is just say no " , says dr . cornell ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revelation of the century .  and that's how simple it is !  in fact i would rather watch 'lost in space' once again , than return to '28 days' .  as for acting , it's acceptable , but hardly anything else .  for sandra bullock it's an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than 'speed' .  she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop .  dominic west shines as the source of gwenie's devilish temptations , but elizabeth perkins' and steve buscemi's great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters .  although intellectually 'girl , interrupted' was a greater achievement , '28 days' is superior in its visual aspect .  there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing , but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor .  the most important thing is that we've seen it before and it was a lot better .  'clean and sober' , 'only when i laugh' , 'when a man loves a woman' , 'leaving las vegas' and many other stronger films were made about the same issues .  so what's the point ?  in other words '28 days' doesn't contribute to the moviemaking business on any level .  if you're caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you're standing in front of the movie theatre , you might as well go in and watch '28 days' .  under all other circumstances stay away , because this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost .  
1 the ultimate match up between good and evil , " the untouchables " is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry .  based on the 1959 television show of the same title , " the untouchables " may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script .  the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public .  elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order .  however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws .  the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes .  the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws .  the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl .  from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard .  right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs .  this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced .  i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone .  the film only gets better from this point .  with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats .  they walk in unison and they only look forward .  as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens .  holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films .  one that comes to mind is " the matrix " when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world .  wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless .   " the untouchables " has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film .  the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army .  each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others .  elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film .  he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be .  however , as the film develops so does ness .  his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side .  he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends .  his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in .  sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables .  malone acts as a mentor to ness .  he teaches him " the chicago way " to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun .  connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed .  andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer .  as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him .  charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone .  smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film .  the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen .  also very similar to " the matrix , " they are exciting and intense .  >from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed .  the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement .  its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors .  the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective .  although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action .  some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid .  
1 there is nothing like american history x in theaters or on video .  no other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure , the culture , and the brotherhood of white supremacy .  nice guy ed norton jr . ( who sang in everyone says i love you ) plays derek , a twenty-year old skinhead .  dad's subtle racism grew large in derek , after gang members killed his father .  dad was fighting a fire when they shot him .  now derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart .  derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence .  at a basketball court , black and white tempers flare .  derek channels the aggression into a game , black versus white , for ownership of the courts .  when the choice presents itself , derek goes for game point instead of the sucker-punch .  cameron ( stacy keach ) steps in to derek's life as a surrogate father .  he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings .  keeping his own criminal record spotless , he uses derek as a leader and organizer for high-visibility racial intimidation .  derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race-motivated mob crimes .  at the bottom of the chain , derek's younger brother danny ( edward furlong , made famous in terminator 2 ) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons , but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong .  one night three black youths break into derek's truck , which is exactly what derek has been waiting for .  outside in his shorts and his tattoo , he shoots them all .  the third would-be thief , unarmed , is only wounded .  in the key scene of the film , derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious , enraptured , awful stomp .   ( the fun-spoiling nc-17 of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate , considering american history x was rated r . what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal , ecstatic violence ? )  the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief .  derek does not resist the cops , and as they spin him around to cuff him , the film slows down .  derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a chilling , sadistic , satisfied grin .  now in prison , derek faces new challenges .  as the black man in the laundry tells him , " in the joint , you the nigra , not me . "  there is a clique of swastika-wearing skinheads , but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy .  they only use the symbols as a means of intimidation .  derek finds himself truly alone , truly in danger , and truly afraid .  when derek finally gets out of prison , he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed .  without derek's leadership , they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist culture .  it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he's screwed up .  in the end , he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny .  the film ends a little too deliberately , too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film , but it barely detracts from the overall experience .  edward norton gives an oscar-worthy performance .  although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction , norton's performance compensated .   ( an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store . )  he also captured the essence of an older brother .  he took his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously , very lovingly , both before and after his change of heart .  though clearly not for all tastes , this film is bold and daring .  the subject matter is ugly , cruel , and at times hard to look at .  nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity's great face .  kaye gives us a good look at this fascinating , if distasteful , american subculture .  
0 senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a one-joke concept a bit too far .  director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this , having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies .  marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon , a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage .  however , he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition , scott thorpe ( david spade , in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep ) : an athletic record , sponsorship by a fraternity , and , most of all , a wealthy family to back him up .  in fact , darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet .  but there may be a light at the end of that tunnel .  he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university's dr . wheedon ( brad dourif ) .  as a result , his senses are magnified tenfold .  using his newfound abilities , he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job ( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side-effects to having super senses ) .  naturally , marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle , giving jim carrey-ish amounts of physical humor .  the problem is , aside from a few genuinely inspired bits , there's not much that's funny here .  the film has it's one central gag , and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor .  there obviously wasn't much thought put into the plot .  the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous .  i mean , why the emphasis on extra-curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single-elimination quiz anyhow ?  and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester ?  to give it credit , senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl's roommate , tim laflour ( matthew lillard ) .  apparently , he is supposed to be faddish , but the film never does anything with him , leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie .  his " intervention " scenes with darryl , however , do provide a rare , and welcome , laugh .  and then there's the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one .  in this case , the object of darryl's amor is janice ( tamara taylor ) , a fellow student who won't have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super-senses .  needless to say , the romance is completely extraneous , and adds little to the film .  this is a film that desperately needed something else .  be that a good plot , more jokes ( or simply funnier ones ) , or a strong character or two , anything would have helped senseless get off the ground .  as it is , all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can't help marlon wayans get this one off the ground .  
0 retrospective : city of the living dead ( 1980 )  a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson  i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as " dim-witted " .  and by golly , just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead .  although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career , this is not one of them .  two points in the movie's favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi - keep things from falling totally into the abyss , but by and large city of the living dead is a failure .  and like most cinematic failures , it comes down to bad writing , dumb performances and lousy direction .  the story starts in new york when , during a seance , a medium ( katherine mccoll ) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich , massachusetts .  for reasons we won't go into here , this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth .  the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance , but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist ( christopher george ) .  that scene in itself is a howler : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside ?  and don't cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they're buried ?  anyway , off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world , where various grisly goings-on are already happening as all saints day approaches .  fulci's graphic gore is in evidence once again , but here it only serves to further highlight the film's flimsy script and plodding direction .  the dialogue , in all manner of speaking , is unspeakable .  not bad in the quotable sense , like an ed wood film , but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious " lets explain the plot " type approach .  mccoll doesn't have a clue who her character is : deadly serious one minute , frivolous the next , she at times is genuinely hard to watch .  and the geezer ( the actor's name escapes me ) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses .  christopher george's performance is salvageable , but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we don't care .  in fact we don't care for anyone in city of the living dead , though in other fulci films that hasn't mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man , as he was in the beyond .  as a director , some of fulci' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here .  he constantly uses extreme close-ups of people's eyes , a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren't capable of .  and despite some gruesome violence , he barely manages a single scare in the entire film .  long-time collaborator fabio frizzi , talented but always erratic , offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie , gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro-pop that's quite frankly embarrassing .  fulci's other films of this period may be flawed - house by the cemetery , the beyond , the black cat - but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration , atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey .  for completists only .  
1 men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction , action , and comedy that hits the target in every possible way .  although another alien movie , men in black succeeds in every way that independence day didn't , and towers above many other movies of its type .  the brilliant acting , especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay , is also as good as it gets .  director barry sonnenfeld , who was behind the camera for the addams family movies and get shorty , has crafted a masterpiece .  the story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be .  the men in black , or mib , are a top-secret governmental agency that is not known to exist .  the mib are responsible for " saving the world from the scum of the universe " .  a though job , indeed .  the film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens ( the human kind ) being transported across the mexico border and into the united states .  presumably , these " aliens " are all migrant workers .  that is , until the mib show up and begin interrogating them .  agent kay selects a particular suspicious worker and takes him away from the other local authorities to discover that he is not an illegal human alien , but a real extra-terrestrial alien .  when the alien makes a run for it , agent kay is forced to eliminate the alien with one of the mib's very unique weapons , and after one of the local law enforcement officers witnesses this bizarre occurrence , agent kay is forced to use another very unique device on them .  the device , described as " out of state " , eliminates the memory of anyone it is used on .  >from here , we are introduced to james edwards , played very well by will smith .  edwards , a police officer , is chasing a fleeing criminal .  the criminal gives a very good chase , and at one point when edwards confronts him , the criminal pulls out a very different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hit the ground .  edwards continues to chase the very athletic criminal to the top of a building , where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go , because someone is after him .  edwards doesn't take this seriously , but when the criminal shows very non-human characteristics and leaps off the building , he begins to wonder .  back at the police station , agent kay shows up to ask edwards a few questions .  he informs edwards that is was , in fact , a non-human that he was chasing , and that the gun he pulled out was definitely not man-made .  he has edwards identify the gun , and asks edwards to come to the mib headquarters the following day .  edwards arrives and finds that he is involved in a recruiting process , along with various other men who seem a bit more qualified than he .  after goofing up for half of the time , edwards puts on a show at the firing range , and agent kay notes the reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib : he chased down the " criminal " on foot , which is something that no one is supposed to be able to do .  in the meantime , an upstate new york farm has a very close encounter .  edgar ( vincent d'onofrio ) , owner of the farm , investigates a strange crash landing and is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object , which presumes to jump inside edgar and use his body as a human transport .  the " bug " , as he is called , is an intergalactic terrorist who has come to earth to attempt to kill two ambassadors .  and it up to the mib , with newly recruited agent jay ( formerly james edwards ) to exterminate the bug and save the planet from intergalactic war .  men in black delightfully combines fast-paced action with often hilarious comedy , which is usually from will smith , although tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film .  the special effects are also very well done and are not the entire source of the plot , as in another big alien film from the past summer .  screenwriter ed solomon , writer of super mario bros .  and the upcoming x-men film , has surely struck gold with this story .  all ages will enjoy men in black .  it is an extremely fun film that you will want to see again .  although it runs a very quick and speedy 96 minutes , the entire film from beginning to end is a non-stop adventure .  the ending of the film , which ties up a few loose ends for one of the main characters , is also very well done .  a sequel is already being planned , so there is more to look forward to !  
1 one of the best things about my job is that , every so often , a film still catches me by surprise .   " spy kids " certainly did .  an adventure story aimed primarily at children , the movie is smart , zippy fun .  the production neither panders nor talks down to its audience .  the brother and sister at the center of the tale are believable , likable kids and their parents are ? get ready for this ? intelligent , capable and loving .  bathroom humor is kept to a minimum and the numerous well-staged action scenes avoid excessive violence .  what a relief it is to be able to review an all-ages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics .  consider the other pg rated " family friendly " movie in theaters now .   " see spot run " has a mother going out of town , leaving her son with an idiot neighbor .  body function humor abounds , including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop .  what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film .  the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process .  at the hospital , the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn't bit off the other one , because two metal replacement balls would clack together .  of course , the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells .  somebody clue me in ? when did genital mutilation become funny ?   " spy kids " is a welcome antidote to the repellent " see spot run , " using imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness .  carmen ( alexa vega ) and her younger brother juni ( daryl sabara ) live in a beautiful seaside home with their parents , gregorio ( antonio banderas ) and ingrid cortez ( carla gugino ) .  mom and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children .  what the kids don't know is that they are also former spies .  once agents from different countries assigned to " erase " each other , they instead fell in love , married and retired to raise a family .  needless to say , they get drawn back to the business .  shortly into their first joint mission , they are captured and end up in the headquarters of fegan floop ( alan cumming ) , a foppish hybrid of willy wonka and pee wee herman who hosts juni's favorite tv show .  but there is evil behind the scenes , as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children .  papa gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get it from him .  back at home , " uncle " felix ( cheech marin ) shows up to reveal mom and dad's secret to the kids .  after a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stores , carmen and juni set off to find their parents and save the world , zooming through the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish , while a slew of wicked people ( including teri hatcher ) chase them .  during the course of their adventures , they get to use jet packs , electroshock bubblegum and super-computer sunglasses .  they watch as secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with silly putty faces and used as background characters on floop's tv show .  they deal with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms , legs and heads would normally be ( why are the guards so ineffective ?  because they're all thumbs ! )  they move from one colorful locale to another , including a nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from " star trek . "  the storyline is silly and convoluted , but even at its most dense , it is easier to follow than either " mission : impossible " movie .  director robert rodriguez ( " from dusk to dawn " ) maintains a frenetic pace , with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes .  a bit less action and a little more character development would have been nice , but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family .  alexa vega and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother and sister team , squabbling the way kids do , but coming together when it counts .  antonio banderas and carla gugino are even better as the parents ; they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes .  even the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments ? a virtual cloud-backed chat between his character and juni is one of the best segments in the film .  had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that , i would have enjoyed the film more ( and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mc-ubiquitous company ) .  regardless , " spy kids " is a hoot , offering fun for adults and children alike .  and just think , they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle .  
0 if you don't think kevin kline in drag is funny , wait ? til you see will smith in drag-it's even less funny .  by the time jim west ( smith ) disguised himself as a belly dancer to bail his captured comrade , artemus gordon ( kline ) , from the clutches of evil dr . loveless ( branagh ) , i was unequivocally bored by wild wild west , the new summer blockbuster from men in black director barry sonnenfeld .  is the old west really a breeding ground for high comedy , anyway ?   ( if your answer is no , then you recall rustler's rhapsody or back to the future part iii ; if your answer is yes , you're thinking of blazing saddles , but that movie was a parody of the western genre , not a nineteenth century romp . )  1869 . jim west is a quick-draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon , under orders from president grant ( kline again , whose impression , for all we know , is dead-on ) , to apprehend legless loveless , the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states and sell it back to britain and spain .  how will loveless accomplish this ?  well , by hulking around the desert in an enormous , mechanical tarantula , of course .  bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar ( hayek ) , whose scientist father was kidnapped by loveless , joins west and gordon on their gadget-filled train .   ( gordon first discovers rita in a cage , waiting to be rescued . )  racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west , despite the movie's " hip " attitude toward the black thing .   ( west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a " nigger " before that person can finish speaking the word .  super . )  at any rate , i kept waiting for rita to say something humourous , but she's a walking dress-up toy .   ( her single comic moment is also the best shot of the film : she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek-a-boo flap of her pyjamas . )  jim west is the role that finally stymied will smith , whose comic timing has always been hit or miss , as episodes of " the fresh prince of bel-air " demonstrate .  smith's a better reactor than actor , which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in black-he didn't start out a hero .  in wild wild west he's required to exude eastwood cool and amuse at the same time ( and from frame one ) , a difficult feat i'm not sure any living performer could pull off .  smith is ill equipped , for example , to handle the moment in which jim west performs stand-up for some rednecks at his own hanging .  what attracted sonnenfeld to this material ?  this isn't the first time he has adapted a tv show for the big screen ( the addams family , anyone ? ) , but it's the first big stinker of his career as a director .  wild wild west is poorly-paced bombast , full of doa gags ( ted levine shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid ; levine played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs-he's too intense to get an intentional laugh ) , lousy special effects ( the bluescreening is amateurish-foregrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds ) , and frequent illogic .   ( to wit , its ridiculous villain so badly wants jim west out of the way that he . . . drops  him onto a steel platform to do battle with some generic , ugly henchmen , instead of shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board the tarantula . )  wild wild west's bright spots , such as the cool opening credits sequence , bai ling's all-too-brief appearance as a femme fatale , or the brilliant " his master's voice " joke , are all part of the film's first half , which is more clever and enjoyable , at least , than its second .  when , towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west , gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and west rejects it , there was a collective groan among audience members : it meant we were going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider , the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whiz-bang finale .  
0 this is the worst movie i've viewed so far in 98 .  the avengers = silly = man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil , sir august de wynter wearing kilt .  the question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast ?  the same question was probably asked of last year's stinker batman and robin .  i feel the production got a little too smug , the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie .  my greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed ( thurman and fiennes ) ? something that was a vital element of the 60's tv serial of the same name .  the dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks , but does not allow much room for character development and interaction , except to perhaps grate on the viewer's nerves .  one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality .  connery as sir august , does not fair better than thurman or fiennes .  his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather , mostly embarrassing and poor quality .  if there is a movie you would prefer never to see , i believe the avengers would be a good choice .  for one thing , you will not have to witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title .  i cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released , but i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature , like lightning you can't see it coming until it hits you .  
0 the happy bastard's quick movie review  wild wild west  a better name for this movie might've been " wild wild waste " .  warner bros . , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib's success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big-screen update to the classic western/sci-fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad .  but somehow , they ran into a problem along the way .  they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would've made all the difference- a story writer .  wild wild west's story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon .  if warner bros . had gotten him , the movie would've possibly been five times better than what it is .  heck , ten times .  as is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he's performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well .  here's the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam-controlled wheelchair .  they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path .  as i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess .  but the acting doesn't help either .  kevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado .  smith seems to be having a better time as west , although he's not nearly as charming as he was in mib .  branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can't even stand to look at him or his strange beard .  and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention .  her acting is barely passable , but what a " breath of fresh ass " .  director barry sonnenfeld isn't of great help either .  even though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost .  it's as if he feels he's directing a tv movie , a big no-no when you're helming what's supposed to be a big-screen hit .  last but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable .  at one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline's train .  he jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it's still in motion !  also , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks .  last but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he's not kissing a woman as he's looking through a peephole at the enemy ? !  the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects .  the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show .  there's also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity .  i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really isn't possible .  if the racist and sex jokes don't bother you , the performances will .  if the performances don't bother you , the story will .  if the story doesn't bother you , the racist and sex jokes will .  there's no end to the vicious circle .  go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats .  you'll have a better time .  if you do go , keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant .  i bet he wishes he were somewhere else . . .  
1 your friends and neighbors is a rather bizarre film about 6 people , who hop in and out of bed with each other .  written and directed by neil labute , who's first film , " in the company of men " was simply marvelous , disappoints a bit here with this one .  the story involves two couples ( ben stiller & catherine keener and aaron eckhart & amy brenneman ) , an artist assistant ( nastassja kinski ) , and an egotistical women abuser ( jason patric ) .  the character's names are not apparent and are not mentioned in the entire movie .  each of the characters has their own sexual style and they don't seem to " merge " together well .  so the group experiments behind their respective partners back .  there are some hysterical scenes , one involves jason patric , aaron eckhart , and ben stiller's characters .  they are all in a sauna , talking about their best " lay " , when jason patric's character makes a surprising confession .  the whole scene is hilarious and exceptionally well written and acted .  the enjoyed this movie , although it seemed a tad lengthy ( even though it only runs 99 min . ) .  the film's cast is exceptional with oscar caliber performances by catherine keener , aaron eckhart , and jason patric .  i would not recommend this film , to people who are offended by conversations that are very sexually explicit .  it did seem to offend people , more than half of the people in the theater left during the film .  although your friends and neighbors doesn't have the power of labute's earlier film it still manages to be somewhat entertaining and funny , while maintaining a melancholy philosophy on human relationships .  
1 as fairy tales go , cinderella has to be one of the most famous .  almost everyone knows it , well at least in north america .  so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it .  it has been done before with varying results .  this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time .  the basic story remains unchanged but , one thing that seems to vanish with this version , and that is all the fantastical elements of the story .  there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature .  after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least .   .  unlike in the fairy tale , the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end .  the ? prince' , who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france , meets 'cinderella' , known as danielle , on a few occasions , most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her .  although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling . .  the story takes place in a renaissance setting ; in france , with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion .  this addition of leonardo da vinci , was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie , since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical .  for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired .  for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle , a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that .  especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne .  the characters of danielle ( cinderella ) played by drew barrymore , and that of the evil step mother , played by anjelica huston , are well developed and well played by the two women .  although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable .  the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie .  as a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique .  but , anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly .  the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella , but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable .  the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise .  all in all this movie takes you back into history , into a seemingly magical fairy land .  but , don't get me wrong there is nothing but reality , it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening .  so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not , and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing  
0 synopsis : back-up quarterback moxxon becomes starting quarterback midway through his senior year of high school , even though he'd rather read " slaughterhouse five " than the playbook .  evil football coach kilmer throws away moxxon's book , though , while the evil team physician injects painkillers into the players .  in the meantime , moxxon's kid brother forms a cult , and a bubblegum-blond cheerleader smears whip cream on herself to seduce the new star quarterback .  comments : since i usually review horror and science fiction films , i feel a little out of my league discussing this teen football movie .   ( pun intended .  thank you ! )  varsity blues was produced by mtv , and it really shows .  several extended scenes allow for a continual soundtrack of mediocre pop songs meant to appeal to the adolescent male audience this crap was intended for .  the teenagers all have reasons for their melodramatic angst .  the adults all have problems , of course , and , as one-dimensional characters , they are all fanatically obssessed with how their local high school football team performs .  yes , this movie represents high school life in mtv-land .  this is a land where your health teacher is also a part-time stripper , your ice cream store attendant girlfriend wears an egyptian ankh around her neck , your kid brother forms a " cute " cult , your football coach is an uncaring , obssessive madman , and your friends' lives consist of nothing but getting laid and driving around in cop cars naked .  all you , as the main character , want to do , however , is read " slaughterhouse five " and attend brown university in the fall .  well , at least this is a little more realistic than mtv's " the real world . "  varsity blues stars james van der beek , this week's teen tv star making the leap to the big screen .  he plays the hick moxxon adequately , though some of his emotional dialogue will make people chuckle .   ( " you dawn't own mah life ! "  who would want to ? )  jon voight , the stock evil guy in countless other movies , is , surprise , the stock evil guy here .  but is he really evil , or is he a product of society ?  after all , everybody , young and old , in this movie has no life whatsoever and do nothing but obssess over high school football .  maybe the pressures of the 90 screaming fans at the football field drove evil coach kilmer evil .  the film's screenplay never answers this burning question .  at times , iliff's story does show glimmers of touching or humorous scenes , but , before the audience gets their hopes up that there might be something redeeming in this movie , they get trashed with another lengthy party sequence or overwrought football game .  the movie's pacing is slow , and the plot turns are mindnumbingly obvious from start to finish .  i suppose i'm being a little hard on varsity blues .  maybe i'm just a little miffed that i had to pay 3 bucks to see it , even though it was dollar night at the cinema .  something about a request from the studio made the theater charge more money .  i found the film oftentimes ludicrous and boring .  three guys in front of us smuggled beer into the the theater .  i wished i had thought of that .  alcohol , lots of it , may have helped the viewing experience .

1 since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller " blood simple , " joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic , original , and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood .  their films are highly stylized , deeply embedded in a particular time and place , and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances .  in " the big lebowski , " their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award-winning " fargo , " the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war , and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski , aka the dude .  the dude is played by jeff bridges -- one of hollywood's most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high .  the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties .  he has shaggy , shoulder-length hair , a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim , and he wears mostly stained tee-shirts , long shorts , and gellies without socks .  he smokes a lot of pot , drinks a lot of white russians , and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies , a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) , one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation , but never quite makes it in .  one day , the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski ( david huddleston ) , this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife , bunny ( tara reid ) , owes a lot of people a lot of money .  the main plot and all its accompanying side-plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here .  suffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money .  by the time all is said and done , walter has become deeply involved , as has the big lebowski's daughter , maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist performance artist , a pornographer named jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) , and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare , who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in " fargo . "   " the big lebowski " plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers' earlier efforts .  it shares their previous films' strong sense of time and place , as well as their send-ups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies .   " lebowski " has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made " raising arizona " such a hoot ; it has surrealistic dream sequences ( one of which involves a busby berkley-like dance number ) that characterized the ending of " barton fink " ; and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded " the hudsucker proxy . "  the film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked with the coens on three other films , " barton fink , " " the hudsucker proxy , " and " fargo . "  deakins always gives the coens' films a distinctive visual style , and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties , whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude's main competitor jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , or the strikingly manic dream sequences , one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball's point of view .  if " fargo " was the coen brothers' most restrained effort in years , " the big lebowski " marks their return to over-the-edge filmmaking .  it is overflowing with style and attitude , which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end .  the coens fill the screen with lighting , set design , music , and hilarious performances from all the leads , especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman , who shows real comic timing in his untimely 'nam-inspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism .  with joel directing , ethan producing , and both writing , the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out .  their talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality , but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring them to light .  the coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world , and they put them center-stage to show that it's not just guys like the dude who are nuts , but the entire planet .  
1 by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom .  gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million .  tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi .  minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone .  the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that .  that is until about half-way through the movie .  suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , " this is your ransom .  but this is as close as you will ever get to it .  instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . "  at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts .  the last half of the film is very well done .  another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie .  owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : " it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . "  before this movie , sinise played mostly " good guys , " first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 .  but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad .  gibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance .  although most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film .   ,  
1 synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners .  cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves .  technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave .  lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men .  three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery .  a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters .  opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life .  in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion .  real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved .  spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story .  djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances .  
1 why do people hate the spice girls ?   ? what exactly have they done wrong , other than perhaps offend the fashion police ?   ? so what if they are not " great " singers---they ain't singing opera , folks , its pop music !   ? who exactly is a " great " singer ?  judging by that opening paragraph it is obvious that i like the spice girls .   ? they do what they do--sing some catchy tunes--and they do it pretty well .   ? they are able to carry that into their first film , " spice world " .   ? " spice world " certainly isn't a great filmgoing experience .   .   .  what it is what the spice girls are all about : fun , songs , and a lot of " girl power ! "  drawing from a number of different films ( like the beatles' " hard day's night " ) " spice world " chronicles the week heading up to the girls' first concert at london's albert hall .   ? they get to tool around london in a big ol' bus ( driven by meat loaf ! ) and generally have fun .   ? in order to through a semblence of plot into the film , there is an evil tabloid publisher played by barry humphries , better known to americans , for about 15 minutes , as dame edna ( remember her ? )   ? he wants to sabotage the girls' concert so he can sell papers .  of course , the point in a movie like " spice world " isn't plot .   ? the center of the film is the spice girls themselves : ginger ( the recently departed geri haliwell ) , posh ( victoria adams ) , sporty ( melanie chisolm ) , scary ( melanie brown ) , and baby ( emma bunton ) .   ? each one has their own personality and , perhaps the best part of the film , look like they are having some honest-to-goodness fun , something that can't be said for a lot of people in films today .  along for the ride are richard e . grant as their manager , clifford , and various other characters making quick cameo appearances ( including teriffic british actors like richard briers and stephen fry ) .   ? and , every once and a while , roger moore pops up as the chief to spout odd koans ( added bonus : he gets to , in the words of craig kilborn , dance , dance , dance . )  watching this film was fun , for the most part .   ? there are a few slow segments , but overly , director bob spiers keeps things moving at a quick pace , with plenty of hummable spice girls songs in the background .   ? his camerawork is fairly pedestrian , though the final concert number is done quite well with effective use of editing .   ?  the look of the film promotes the high fun , with the design of the spicebus being quite original and eye-catching .   ? add in wall-to-wall spice girls music and this film is lovable romp .   ? if you don't like the spice girls , you won't change your mind with this film .   ? but , if you find them at least tolerable , get ready to sit back and chill because the spice girls are here to entertain you .   .   .  and do it quite well .   ?

0 from dusk till dawn ( director/editor : robert rodriguez ; screenwriters : quentin tarantino/robert kurtzman ( story ) ; cinematographer : guillermo navarro ; cast : quentin tarantino ( richie gecko ) , george clooney ( seth gecko ) , juliette lewis ( kate fuller ) , harvey keitel ( jacob fuller ) , ernest liu ( scott fuller ) , salma hayek ( santanico pandemonium ) , tom savini ( sex machine ) , fred williamson ( frost ) , cheech marin ( border guard/chet pussy/carlos ) , michael parks ( texas ranger ) , brenda hillhouse ( hostage gloria ) ; runtime : 108 ; dimension films ; 1996 )  reviewed by dennis schwartz  it's a love it or hate it film .  i simply hated it .  on its menu for fun , is a violent feast served up as charm and done in a tongue-and-cheek manner .  it's a serial killer/horror film farce of nonstop over-the-top action and sleaze , involving decapitations , vampires , biker fights , extended gun play , and an array of gore that has to be seen to be believed .  a film that regales in its vulgarity and campiness for blood-and-gore , as it goes out of its way to gloss over the clich ? s of the conventional b-films .  it's geared only for the cult film crowd , and will make its mark there one way or the other .  the plot involves two psychopath brothers , the older professional bank robber and killer seth gecko ( clooney ) and the perverted psychopath killer , richie ( tarantino ) , who kills for pleasure and is also a rapist .  they escape jail and go on a killing spree in wichita and then flee to a liquor store in a small texas border town .  they have just robbed a bank and killed a number of cops , they have also taken a middle-aged bank teller as a hostage .  in the liquor store they kill a texas ranger and the store clerk , and burn down the store .  stopping off in a flop-house motel , richie rapes and slaughters the hostage .  these scenes are all done with an eye for comedy and parody , if that's possible .  on the tv news , it says they have killed 16 so far and most are texas rangers .  the brothers plan to get to mexico and meet carlos ( cheech ) , who will give them a place of sanctuary for thirty percent of their illegal take .  with road blocks and car searches at the border , the brothers commandeer a motor home of a vacationing family who stopped at their motel so that the father could sleep in a real bed .  there is the father , jacob fuller ( keitel ) , who just resigned as a minister because he lost faith ever since his wife died in a car accident ; his sexy 20-year-old , innocent daughter , kate ( lewis ) ; and , her shy brother scott ( liu ) .  it's not explained how he happens to be chinese .  the story really becomes bizarre when they get across the border and get ready to meet carlos in a bar/whorehouse for truckers and bikers called the titty twister .  the place is open from dawn to dusk , thus the film's title .  here's where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some absurd fun , as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout .  it sells sex to its patrons , and has exotic stripper santanico pandemonium ( hayek ) do her alluring strip before turning into a vampire .  the brothers and their hostages have to fight their way out of the place , as the vampires keep coming and the killings become the film's staple .  this supposedly clever script did nothing but turn me off , though there were a few funny moments in a film that was dripping with special effects and spent most of its script in finding novel ways to showcase its killings .  i'll take a pass on this one , it's just not my style of a film .  the characters were as empty as the story , and the film was an easy one to forget .  
0 mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival .  as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival .  it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time .  in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry .  toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart .  the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it .  something else is what he did .  the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life .  she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep .  meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada .  she wants to build a career as an actress .  betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow .  she does not know who the woman is .  she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is .  they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not .  meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own .  he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) .  these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong .  there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion .  in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits .  a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun .  lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film .  he just chooses not to .  as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason .  there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches .  the film is a little long for the subject matter .  toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot .  unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers .  i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  mulholland drive spoiler warning .  i have rated this film fairly low .  you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film .  david lynch is in large part a dark satirist .  most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside .  in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre .  what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? )  playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on .  the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout .  then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something .  the audience expectation is that they will add up .  but he has given clues that are self-contradictory .  lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories .  in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke .  there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties .  mad magazine called it a poiuyt .  other sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar .  look at small portions of it and makes sense .  look at the whole figure and it does not .  this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar .  
0  " practical magic , " is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one .  the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens , two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches , spanning back 200 years .  at the start , their parents die when they are still children , and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest ) .  switch to the present day , gillian , who is the stronger , more rebellious sibling , leaves home , and meets up with a dark , abusive guy ( goran visjnic ) , while sally stays in their hometown , meets and falls in love with a sweet , caring man , has two children , and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it , she's not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes ) .  when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic , they accidentally murder him , and in desperation , bury the body in the backyard of their aunts' house .  add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism , not to mention a spattering of " light-hearted whimsy , " and you have a pretty good idea how messy " practical magic " is .  after seeing the film , i reflected that there was not even one scene , or element , that i liked or enjoyed .  it is a comedy , to be sure , but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat , and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching .  it is not charming or entertaining in any way .  and then to top it off , we've got this dark , but bird-brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian's body .  whatever .  the characters are handled terribly , and actually , most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character .  there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film , and in every scene involving them , they are always standing side-by-side .  no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people .  the same goes for aidan quinn , as a handsome police investigator , who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock , even though he comes into it at around the 70-minute mark , and once again , there is no attempt to develop their relationship , or his character , in any way .  in fact , every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along , rather than getting to know the people saying the lines .  i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits , when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman , who managed to destroy the " batman " series with " batman forever " and " batman and robin . "   " practical magic " is directed by griffin dunne , primarily an actor , who last year made the contrived , clumsy romance , " addicted to love , " with meg ryan and matthew broderick .  i disliked that movie quite a bit , but since " practical magic " is even worse , that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is .  i'd tell him to quit while he's ahead , but in these last two years , he's ultimately already buried himself .  
1 rated : r for strong language , sexual dialogue , drug use , crude humor , violence and brief nudity .  starring : ben affleck , matt damon , linda fiorentino , salma hayek , alan rickman , chris rock , kevin smith , jason mewes , jason lee , george carlin , alanis morissette .  running time : 130 minutes  being a huge fan of kevin smith , i was expecting a lot out of his newest project 'dogma' .  it might just be kevin's best work to date .  it's very funny with smart and foul-mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ , it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there isn't .  in 1994 a little $27 , 000 movie premiered at sundance .  this little film was called 'clerks' and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation .  you really can't meet a person on this green earth who has not seen 'clerks' .  it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming .  in 1995 kevin made another movie 'mallrats' that flopped horribly , thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick .  it was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in 1997 'chasing amy' came out and was kevin's biggest success to date .  now in 1999 we get a great little movie by the name of 'dogma' .  wow ! what a cast .  ok here is the plot in this movie : linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic .  one day at her house metatron ( the voice of god ) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels ( matt damon and ben affleck ) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church .  ok now get this , she is told to find two prophets : one who talks a lot and one who doesn't , however she gets jay and silent bob instead ( who give us great performances ) .  now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky ( chris rock ) and helps guide her to find these angels .  salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way .  azrael ( jason lee ) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win .  bethany ( linda fiorentino ) has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith .  what a movie , it is everything rolled into one : an offensive , offbeat , smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end , and ends up being a feel-good movie .  who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself .  now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart .  yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot , but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven , it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god .  this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie .  kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie .  of course the best ( and funniest ) of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob .  probably the best characters in movies that i like .  the star-studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin , jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while .  the script was written by kevin smith with many f'words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn't and makes us laugh at the same time as we think .  chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well , with some classic lines .  linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is .  of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay ( as well as silent bob ) .  alan rickman , jason lee , salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles .  being oscar winners for the classic 'good will hunting' they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could .  ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story .  the movie's only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it .  however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , 'dogma' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to 'clerks' .  while being funny at times , in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can't deny it .  'dogma' will offend people , especially deeply religious people , but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you .  all kevin smith fans must see ! !  
0 she was the femme in " la femme nikita . "  he was the baldwin in " backdraft , " " sliver , " and " fair game " ( with cindy crawford ) .  together , anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make " shattered image " the biggest piece of hooey since the stallone/stone " thriller " " the specialist . "  the film poses the question " what if the life you're living now is really a dream , and your dreams reality ? "  it's either about a woman who's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she's a hired assassin , or it's about a hired assassin who's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she's honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica .  it doesn't much matter and believe me by the time " shattered image " runs its painful and pedestrian course you won't care .  these two lives , with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig , black emotionless eyes , and black leather clothing in the seattle-based assassin scenes , and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes , play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it's now * twice * as boring as it might have been .  it's not that complicated plots can't be entertaining .  of course it helps if you have interesting characters , crisp dialogue , and a modicum of style .   " shattered image " isn't complex , it's just stupid .  and boring .  parillaud and baldwin , who aren't exactly shakespearean material to begin with , are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines .  lines like :   " you don't beg , you insist .  i like that in a woman . "  that's parillaud's character talking . . .  to her cat !  and :   " you're not the reason i couldn't care less about you . "  huh ?  and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film :   " if you give me a couple of minutes you know i'll charm the pants off you . "   " i don't have that kind of time . "  talking of pants , parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say " point of no return . "  we have come to expect this from billy baldwin , but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first .  but there's nothing to learn .  karen is as interesting as a cereal box , a someone's-out-to-get-me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone , the stranger who sends her flowers , maybe even her husband himself , is her would-be killer .  siouxsie is the chromium cool , tough-as-nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the film's meaningless stock title .  baldwin seems more interested in parillaud's nest egg ( so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot ) than he does in her .  each time graham greene shows up he gets killed .  barbet schroeder ( " reversal of fortune " ) co-produced and should be ashamed of himself .  every now and again it's fun to watch a really bad movie .  and every now and again , as " shattered image " makes agonizingly clear , it isn't .  
0 the last of vampire-films offers plenty of blood and gore , but beyond that - nothing .  jack crow ( james woods ) is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican .  his and his men's mission is to clean the earth from vampires .  they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered , but one has always escaped them .  valek ( thomas ian griffith ) - the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself .  for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation - the black cross .  with the cross in their possesion , the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight .  after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth . . .  i have never liked john carpenter and his style .  after seeing this film , my opinions have not changed .  john carpenter remains john carpenter .  however , because of the film's self-irony , black humour and fascinating cinematography , i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long , long time .  neither the synopses or carpenter's direction are original .  but there are some things that are interesting .  the director's negative view on the catholic church , for instance .  at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba ( maximilian schell ) has simply used crow and his team to find valek , so that he would gain eternal life .  otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool - drinking , smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy .  carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere .  set in new mexican dessert , he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns , symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness .  more than anything in this film , this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil .  the cinematography by gary b . kibbe is probably the film's greatest achievement .  music ( composed by john carpenter himself ) is at times effective , the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice .  when it comes to the cast ( in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem ; everyone can scream and swing the axe ! ) , but here james woods is suprisingly convincing .  he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter , who lost his family to the " breed of evil " .  woods is constantly overacting , which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance .  daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crow's loyal partner .  the other cast members are struggling .  because the film doesn't take itself too seriously , it stays afloat .  still it is like most vampire-films - a mediocre experience .  
0 cashing in on the success of white men can't jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles ( including the cowboy way and drop zone ) , wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed , hoping that they can strike up the same success .  sadly , if this dismal , cliche ridden and mind-numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by , they haven't got a chance in hell of even coming close .  this time out , the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops .  following several run-ins with their tyrannical boss ( robert blake ) , who is obsessed with the " money train " --a train which carries all the subway's takings--and will let nothing stop it ( now * there's * an original plot device ) , harrelson's character decides to try and take off with the cash .  along the way , both of them fall in love with the same woman--another transit cop who also hates her boss .  this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard ( 'you were always the better brother' etc . etc . etc . ) , and doesn't help to add anything to the film .  given a better script , better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time ( the film almost went for two hours--or did it just feel like it ? ) , this film might ( and i mean * might * ) have turned out okay , but as it is , it is stocked with the worst action film cliches , whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time .  robert blake , who plays the evil boss , has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history !  he sounds like wayne newton , and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets !  but this is only one of money train's problems .  if you look at the script as if it was an action film , it lacks originality and suspense .  but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film , it is even worse .  the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely ain't butch and sundance .  the film isn't all bad though .  snipes and harrelson , when they aren't using the dumb cliches that the script gives them , make an agreeable duo , and some of the stunt-work is indeed excellent .  but good stunt-work cannot save a bottom-of-the-barrel action movie .  if you're a really undemanding action freak , there's a chance you'll like this .  but if you're looking for something original , or suspenseful , try somewhere else--i doubt you'll find it here .  
0 in the year 2029 , captain leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , " boogie nights " ) is training 'his' chimp pericles to pilot a pod from the usaf oberon space station .  when an electromagnetic storm is encountered and pericles' pod is lost , davidson sets out unauthorized and lands thousands of years in the future on the " planet of the apes . "  maybe if 20th century fox had set the proverbial 100 chimps in front of typewriters they would have gotten a better results than this adaptation of the pierre boulle novel by william broyles jr . ( " cast away " ) , and lawrence konner & mark d . rosenthal ( " mighty joe young " ) .  director tim burton's unique look and style are nowhere to be found in this silly , pointless remake .  davidson no sooner lands than he finds himself being swarmed by savages running in terror , whom he wisely joins .  however , he's rounded up with the lot of them by the apes which rule this plant and handed over to slave trader limbo ( paul giamatti , " duets " ) .  ari ( helena bonham carter , " fight club " ) , daughter of the illustrious senator sandar ( david warner , " titanic " ) and simian bleeding heart , believes humans should live with apes on equal standing , an unpopular notion .  she takes a liking to leo , who she deems 'unusual . '  general thade ( tim roth , " lucky numbers " ) is of the opposite opinion , wishing for declaration of martial law that will allow him to annihilate the race .  he's sweet on ari .  it's relatively easy to see where this 'new' story is going from the onset , yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes .  the much ballyhooed 'surprise' ending is a nonsensical let down .  an attempt at a love triangle , conveyed by ari and the human daena ( estella warren , " driven " ) giving each other 'back off' looks over leo , fails because he never develops a relationship with either of them .  the lone sex scene is some hilarious foreplay between elder orangutan senator nado ( glenn shadix ) and his trophy wife nova ( burton's squeeze , lisa marie ) .  guffaws will also likely greet charlton heston's cameo as thade's father , the one ape harboring a firearm ( ! ) who sputters some very familiar lines before dying .  the only real success of the 2001 " planet of the apes " is rick baker's makeup , and even that's an iffy affair .  no attempt was made to change the human whiteness of the actors' eyes , a real distraction amidst some otherwise impressive work .  roth , warner and michael clarke duncan ( as thade's right hand man attar ) are given the most impressive makeovers .  giamatti looks more like a skull than an ape and the female apes are too humanized to be given sexual appeal .  tim roth delivers the most impressive acting job by getting the body language right - his nasty chimpanzee character leaps about , most spectacularly when mounting his steed , but even's he's undone by some obvious wire work .  bonham carter delivers a goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic , but is undone in turn by the silliness of the writing .  most of the film has a set bound look which no amount of mist can cover .  the ape's city resembles a dank complex of tree houses .  the apes' military costumes ( colleen atwood , " sleepy hollow " ) as well as their field tents are reminiscent of eiko ishioka's work on coppola's " dracula . "  that oriental flavor is also found in danny elfman's tribal , percussive score .   " planet of the apes " was the last blockbuster hope for the summer of 2001 , a dismal movie season that's going to the dogs .  
1 the last steve martin film i saw , the spanish prisoner , was a very different approach for the comic actor .  as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob " a process " from a clueless businessman , martin's character did it all for money .  in his most recent movie , bowfinger , martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry .  he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name , that will make him more popular at the parties , and , most importantly , that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door .  playing the title role , martin is once again the good guy ; the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie .  this con man is very likeable for some reason , even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner .  maybe the message is that , in hollywood , to win over the trust and friendship of others , you have to be a little evil .  bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars .  martin , who also wrote the screenplay , is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best " peter sellers " in two different , but equally hilarious , roles ; one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy , burger king employee brother .  the story follows aging and failing director/producer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a b-action movie called chubby rain .  in order to attract actors and crew members , bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie .  the only problem is that kit refuses to be in it .  but this won't stop the aggressive bowfinger .  he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him .  he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage .  will bowfinger be able to make his film ?  or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on ?  bowfinger is a very cartoon-like movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line .  the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department .  this is the kind of movie that cameos are all about , it is always funny to see actors/directors/producers making fun of themselves or co-workers especially in a playful movie such as this .  besides the very repetitive and superflous ending , bowfinger is a joy to watch .  if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it .  if you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures , the movie is great fun .  
1 swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults .  steven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie .  and he knows a money making winner when he sees one .  the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action , funny comedy , and the pacing of a rollercoaster .  hopkins plays don diego de la vega , otherwise known as zorro .  a fighter for the people , he is eventually captured by don rafael montero ( stuart wilson ) , who also , unintentionally , kills his wife .  the film cuts to twenty years later , where vega still wants to montero dead .  however , he's far too old now , and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro .  banderas motive ?  to avenge the death of his brother , who was killed at the hands of captain love ( matthew letscher ) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar , in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie .  with the scene set , the movie goes on full blast , with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners .  banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro's , playing each other off with ease .  hopkins seems to come off a little better , but banderas does some excellent work .  as the bad guys , wilson and letscher seem one dimensional , but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way .  the audience does hate them , which can't be bad .  catherine zeta-jones also pops up as hopkins daughter , and although she provides little more than the usual female lead , she delivers a charming , but one note , performance .  the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones .  there's a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight , and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed , until jones clothes fall off all together .  the director , fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye ( 1995 ) handles the film perfectly .  the action is well done and fast paced , the comedy put across well .  the cast help a lot , but the direction is still outstanding .  although the film is very long , the plot keeps chugging along , and there's barely a dull moment .  however , the film is a little over indulgent , and it could have been trimmed .  it manages to hold the attention , thankfully , and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel .  screenwriters john eskow , ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script .  although they've bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action , the plot itself is barely existent .  there's lots of little sub plots hanging around , but there's nothing substantial to bring them all together .  the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to 'buy' california using gold stolen from the guy he's buying the land off .  this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines .  however , this doesn't seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film , so the film is never quite sure where it's going .  in the end however , zorro provides action and comedy in spades .  it suitable for everyone , so put the guilt behind , and put some more money into spielbergs bank account .  you won't regret it .  
0 unfortunately it doesn't get much more formulaic than one tough cop .  there's the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain .  the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys , the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film .  bo dietl ( pronounced deedle , baldwin ) is one tough cop , a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia .  on top of that problem , he has a drunk , gambling addicted partner ( penn ) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets ( i guess cops aren't immune ? ) .  then , throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon ) .  right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama .  but right in the middle of the film , they throw in a completely un-related plot point .  dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from .  the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death .  once the case is solved , the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue .  whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably .  aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso ( an insult if you ask me ) the performances were pretty good .  baldwin , though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec , does a fine job as one tough cop .  penn , who also slips into an impression of his brother sean , is even better as a loser tough guy cop .  what one tough cop lacks is originality .  this film offers nothing new .  nothing that you can't get from any cop film .  it screams sidney lumet all over the place , perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman , producers of lumet's dog day afternoon and serpico .  but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film .  too much else is lacking .  i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture , something that i almost never notice .  but once i saw that , i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot .  at times , i was hoping to see it .  one tough cop isn't laughable , nor is it a terrible film , but it just isn't unique .  it is a classic example of a film that didn't need to be made .  but one thing is for sure , it could really use a better title .  
0 you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the " odd couple ii " sneak preview .  they were as happy a group of men as i've ever encountered .   " what a great movie , " exclaimed one gent at the urinal , " everything was so true ! "   " yeah , " laughed a man standing next to him , " i drive as slow as that one guy did .  my kids give me holy hell for it ! "   " and peeing is a big part of my day , just like with felix , " chuckled another fellow , as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and prepared to rejoin his wife .  if you're over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limit , " neil simon's the odd couple ii " may be just the film for you .  others will likely be less charitable .  while " the odd couple ii " is amiable enough , neil simon's shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slapped-together tv reunion show , suffering from wheezing situation comedy set-ups and jokes straight out of the borscht-belt .  simon , once the toast of broadway , has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson , missouri .  the contrived story , involving the marriage of their kids , provides the excuse for a reunion between oscar madison and felix unger , who haven't seen each other in 17 years .  the former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and , quite literally , run into one another at the airport .  they take off in a rental car for the ceremony in san molina , get lost and have a series of " wacky " adventures on the road .  jack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob .  while there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair , the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that they've headlined three films together since 1993 : " grumpy old men , " " grumpier old men " and " out to sea . "  still , the two veteran actors are fun to watch .  matthau , whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes , has a field day as oscar , the crown prince of the curmudgeons .  lemmon , looking pastier than usual , is fine as the ever- annoying felix , who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of " phnah !  phnah ! "  despite their bickering , the characters have real affection for each other , providing a welcome respite from the non-stop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together .  unfortunately , matthau and lemmon's charm isn't enough to compensate for simon's hack script , which wouldn't pass muster even on a upn sitcom .  one contrived situation follows another , lathered with enough stale one- liners to supply a dozen would-be comics on open-mike night at the local comedy club .  if someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as i was , try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements .  burger king gets one , as does the el pollo loco taco joint , but budget rent-a- car really hits the jackpot .  between script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name , i couldn't keep count of all the plugs .  i did , however , keep track of some of the swearing .  i came up with four " god-damns , " three " shitheads " and two " fucks . "  the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience , but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them , howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with a naughty word .  it's sad that a writer of neil simon's stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs , but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise .  one running gag involves oscar and felix's inability to remember the name of the town where the wedding is to be held .  at one point , the men actually spend 30 seconds just free-associating , riffing off variants of the word " san . "  the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing .  one of the oldest maxims of film-going is " beware of movies that use the author's name in the title . "   " neil simon's the odd couple ii " is no exception to the rule .  while the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon , it has no business playing in a movie theater .  of course , there's a bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word i've written , and would probably whip my " young-whippersnapper " ass to boot .  one thing's for sure , though .  they'll never catch me in a car chase .  
0 don't get me wrong -- i tend to appreciate besson's naive , unashamedly romantic worldview , an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood .  his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving , thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman , and 1997's the fifth element is a goofy paean to love , l-u-v , that's even more of a hoot on repeated viewings .  but his joan of arc is a mess , despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close-cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself .  jovovich , besson's own personal muse through the making of his last two films ( though they've since separated ) , is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan ( as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior , but also a fabulous , supermodel-level babe ) .  and besson remains a servicable action film director , though not an especially facile one .  leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english , joan's struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring , and besson helps you understand how the french could believe , fervently , that god is on her side .  besson's big mistake , i think , is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject .  yes , joan had visions -- but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue-eyed christ figure on display in besson's hallucinatory dream sequences .  the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman ( billed as " the conscience " ) shows up , spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell , babbling like ally mcbeal .  that's kind of a shame , since she does quite well up to that point , charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness .  that darkly attractive aspect of her character -- that she's as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or less betrayed by the final reels , in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she's overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who's about to take a fall .  as the story winds down , with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire , besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance .  trouble is , he's chosen a lurid , often jokey tone for the balance of the picture -- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes -- and it's impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is , to a great extent , nothing more than a put-on .  this glib , pre-fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer's the passion of joan of arc ( 1928 ) , a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan's trial , and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema .  compared to that film , the messenger plays as a crime against history .  -------------------------------------------------------------- directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich france/usa , 1999  theatrical aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 --------------------------------------------------------------  
0 capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace .  there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise .  john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself .   , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) .  john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes .  for a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make .  ghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace .  in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue .  this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness .  it is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way .  but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience .  ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 .  mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film's budget ) .  it is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film .  society has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little .  apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control .  and from carpenter's view , women have really made a mess of things .  society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten .  the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony .  instead of having the criminal " napolean " wilson , this film has the criminal " desolation " williams .  instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars .  because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination .  the story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback .  ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black .  carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat .  sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup .  the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss .  his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring .  these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience .  somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights .  within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars .  after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by .  i rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  following the movie i showed my wife , who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did , carpenter's classic assault on precinct 13 .  her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice .  
1 hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest ) .  it's a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters .  i mean , come on .  are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ?  hell no .  and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films .  and not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk 'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either .  this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu .  i got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays .  and that is exactly what this film is ; art .  i've been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers .  let me backtrack a minute .  when i say " intellectual ground " , i don't mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved .  with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown .  those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen .  you see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore .  this is a thinking man's slasher flick .  the " nosferatu " of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy .  he employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder ) .  upon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock's castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter's ) .  the next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck . . . not  really a good sign .  he then discovers through some reading that the count is a " nosferatu " , or vampire , one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans .  but by the time he pieces this together , he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutter's hometown via boat .  will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ?  the character of orlock is , of course , dracula .  the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker's novel .  just thought that was an interesting little side note . . .  probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment's digitally restored cut , now available in stores .  however , this version is quite different than maunau's original masterpiece .  the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o-negative and color tinting , much like the 1984 version of lang's metropolis .  now , i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here , bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one .  but alas , i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen .  but that's just my bag ; you may like the newer , more " modern " version better .  either way , i suggest investing your money in a copy .  if you like what they have done with it , pop it in the vcr and enjoy .  if you're like me , just do what i'll do during future viewings ; turn the color all the way down on your television , hit mute , turn on some bach or mozart or whatever , dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made .  
0 the following review encompasses two versions of dune :  dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book .  the film's visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative .  dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television .  it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline .  quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web .   * * * the review * * *  released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert's cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans .  director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico .  the screenplay was lynch's own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected .  dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors .  the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that's home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange .  the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe .  it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it .  most importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to " fold space " and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish .  lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands .  one is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis .  the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen .  the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom .  unfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended .  the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office .  with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made .  what a great idea !  why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ?  the most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters .  thus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul's father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless .  the end result is a distinct chill : we can't warm to most of the cast and we don't care much for them .  and it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book .  dune is also a very serous film .  the constant " self-talk " by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment .  the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them .  humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen's mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find .  you may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus' star wars trilogy .  the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however .  it still possesses enough of lynch's stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi .  special effects whiz carlo rambaldi's giant sandworms are an awesome sight .  both the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original .  and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years .  with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses .  see it in the widescreen format if you can .  and despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen .  sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who's secret aim is to manipulate paul's destiny for its own shadowy ends .  as paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade .  the conclusion ?  any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert's original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker .  david lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects .  dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release .  many chose to stay away altogether , as the film's disastrous box office showing attests .  the extended version , however , is a rather different beast .  in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition " director's cut " of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres .  but , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects .  in a way , then , it is partly lynch's own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa .  stung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director's guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with " allen smithee " , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work .  he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous " judas booth " .  certainly , looking at the results of mca's handiwork there's at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object .  but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas .  most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version's storyline .  paul's relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously .  the political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained .  paul's initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably .  and as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe .  as a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv's version of dune is clearly superior .  as a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept .  the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate .  there's some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order .  and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg .  ships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context .  this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so .  it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television .  but the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn't even in herbert's book .  the scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his " heart plug " .  its a surreal and disturbing episode that's very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work .  despite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film .  all up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences .  unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the " alan smithee " version remains the closest we'll get to what the movie should have been .  on repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit .  still , as one of this century's great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen .  with rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga .  
0 the " disney stick-to-what-you-do-best " rule states that disney's animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at live-action kids' entertainment , they will fail miserably .  this goes double for occasions when they try to make a live-action adaptation of a popular cartoon ( remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations ?  i'm still trying to forget ) .  that rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget , an insulting , despicable and , worst of all , expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable children's film .  it will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults , even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes .  it's films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects .  just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet , his career takes a nosedive to hell with his " role " as john brown , a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around him .  he dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush , dr . brenda bradford ( joely fisher ) .  but after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer .  john breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr . brenda's father .  dr . brenda has been working on a " gadget project , " which would make a half-man half-machine super-policeman to fight crime .  feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject , realizing his dream of becoming a policeman .  now , when he says " go go gadget [insert name of gizmo here] " he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks , bang up bandits and mangle murderers .  in the meantime , the evil claw ( rupert everett ) , the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor's father is building a gadget of his own : a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown's worst nemesis .  claw has plans of world domination , which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile ( voice of d . l .  hughley ) to save humanity from his wrath .  state of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere .  had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect .  what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal : all of the expensive f/x amounts to nothing .  part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie .  can kids really admire a hero so goody-two-shoes that he screams " hey !  you ran a stop sign ! "  while hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle ?  i think that today's children will respond better to somebody dashing , someone ultra-cool .  they ( probably ) receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt .  in addition to the more complex complaints above , there's also the simple stuff : inspector gadget is boring , formulaic and achingly implausible .  there's no feeling that the director really cares about his story : more than any other film i've seen this year , this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line .  there's a popular commercial ( for sprite , but that's irrelevant ) running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects .  it consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious ( thank god ) movie called " death slug " .  each executive gleefully presents a different merchandise tie-in ( slug taco !  slug on a stick ! ) .  at the end one of them asks " what about the movie ? "  another answers : " well , we don't have a script yet , but we can bang one out by friday . "  they probably could have replaced " death slug " with inspector gadget .  this film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script .  it's no coincidence that most good children's entertainment these days comes from animation .  animated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride into their work .  these kinds of films are banged out quicker and a good percentage turn out worthless , sloppy and impersonal .  the studios are becoming factories and films their assembled products .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  
1  " jaws " is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen .  the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds .  then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score .  dah-dum .  from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly .  right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once " jaws " has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip .  perhaps what is most outstanding about " jaws " is how spielberg builds the movie .  he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act .  unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act .  until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music .  he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying .  he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery .  the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years .  the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money .  brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute .  hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( " it's a perfect engine , an eating machine " ) make it that much more terrifying .  when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark .  the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it .   " jaws " is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror .  it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by " star wars " ) .  even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's " psycho , " and it never seems to age .  although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill .  the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects .  scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time " jaws " was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman .  nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark .  scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town .   " it's your first summer here , you know , " mayor vaughn warns him .  dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in " american graffiti " ( 1973 ) and " the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz " ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers .  however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards .  bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism .  he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature .  however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars .  quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s .  indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese .  his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen .  shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film .  of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature .  a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in " jaws , " and they are a threat .  every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into .  the shark in " jaws " was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed " bruce " by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles .  many have forgotten , but " jaws " was a sort of precursor to " waterworld " ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb .  but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood .  
1 plot : odin is a great high school basketball player .  he's dating a hot girl and the coach loves his ass .  in fact , the coach even admits to having fatherly feelings towards him .  unfortunately , the coach's real son , hugo , isn't too pleased to hear that .  in fact , he doesn't like hearing about any of odin's triumphs , as they generally supersede his own .  so what does he set out to do ?  well , let's just say that he starts to mess with people's heads and one thing leads to another thing which leads to . . . well ,  you'll see .  critique : a very powerful , thoroughly depressing , well-acted " non-teen " movie starring a bunch of teens .  credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version of this shakespearian classic , set in a realistic high school environment , with the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending sense of doom as it core .  you also have to give it up to all of the actors in this film , who turn over some very convincing performances , taking you through all of their characters' ups and downs .  hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a despicable character , a dude who you just want to grab by the throat and beat the shit out of ( sign of a good actor , if you ask me ) .  phifer also comes to play in this movie , with a nice blend of charisma , fear , love and anger spread over his character .  i was always on this guy's side and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along .  julia stiles was also good , but her character wasn't much different from others that she's played recently .  i was however very surprised with martin sheen's showing , since i hadn't taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few years .  his character is definitely over-the-top in this film , but i appreciated his fervor , his rage , his ultimate and blind desire to win above all .  a great example of a workaholic man who cannot see the trees from the forest .  i did have a few reservations about the movie though .  first of all , what was with all of the gangsta hip-hop music used in pretty much every other scene transition ?  it was cute at first , but became a little too obvious and annoying after a few times .  the film was also edited pretty choppily . . . like  some scenes were cut out and no one " cleaned it up " afterwards .  i also didn't like the fact that hartnett's character , the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down in this film , was infallible .  in other words , pretty much everything he says or asks of someone , happens automatically and without any goofups .  i mean , i know the guy is smart and all , but i would have appreciated a little more " realism " under some of the circumstances .  but overall , the movie will devastate you .  it's not a " fun date movie " .  it's not a movie about the high school basketball team and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the tracks .  it's about jealousy , love , envy , fury , passion , revenge and pretty much any other negative thought that's ever passed through your head .  is it worth seeing ?  oh , most definitely !   ( pun intended ) it's a moving picture with great performances , no shakespearian speak ( thank you , god ! ) and an outstanding directorial job by nelson .  the final scene alone is enough to send a massive chill down your spine , and i was especially impressed with the director's choice of music near the end .  in fact , the whole sequence was quite reminiscent of the final showdown scene from taxi driver , and i guess that's saying something right there .  where's joblo coming from ?  10 things i hate about you ( 7/10 ) - election ( 7/10 ) - hamlet ( 6/10 ) - love's labor's lost ( 8/10 ) - natural born killers ( 9/10 ) - save the last dance ( 7/10 ) - shakespeare in love ( 5/10 )  
0 jet li busted onto the american action movie scene , when he stole the show in 1998's lethal weapon 4 , with his wicked looks , his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma .  it only took another two years for mega-producer joel silver to set him up in an all-american movie , primed to take over some of the empty action-hero seats left by alleged coke-head van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal .  would this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts , namely chow yun-fat and jackie chan ?  let's find out .  plot : rival chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another , when members of their respective families start turning up dead .  that's when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brother's death and to exact some of his own style of revenge .  critique : three words : not enough action !  simple enough ?  not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay , bad actors , crappy dialogue and oh-so many over-the-top melodramatic moments .  and a romance angle ?  why , one must ask . . . why ?  i love fight scenes and i really dig jet li too , but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences , and jet , well , the poor dude was barely in the movie .  and i thought this was supposed to be his big break ?  how 'bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kung-fu fighting chops , slap him in a few more scenes , and give him more chances to practice his acting/english abilities ?  what a letdown .  even black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up , empty shell of a film .  in fact , i am sure that more time was spent gathering the " hits " for the soundtrack of this film , than were on the so-called " screenplay " .  i felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time .  the sad part about the bad script is that it wouldn't matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines .  but no , save lindo and aaliyah , who weren't too shabby , i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly .  and what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some 15-year old looking guy , acting like he's the overlord of a drug ring ? !  what a mess .  then again , i don't want it to seem like i'm complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable , since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway , not the story .  well , i guess that's what disappointed me the most out of this film .  there were a couple of cool fight scenes with li , but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving .  also , as much as i love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some of their stunts , a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt .  it should be seamless , fellas , not necessarily against the laws of gravity !  the one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by a blow , but that simple creative touch couldn't save the rest of this film's uninteresting plot movements .  i'm disappointed for jet li that this film didn't give him the real opportunity to star in a good story with many great action scenes .  hopefully , the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor .  for now , i just hope that for his sake , the film's title isn't a premonition of the movie's ultimate fate at the box-office .  
1 bruce willis is a type-casted actor .  in die hard , he played john mcclaine , a rough and tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time .  again , in pulp fiction , as butch coolidge , an over-the-hill boxer , he steps on the wrong guys toes .  in luc besson's the fifth element , willis plays korben dallas , a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time .  a stylish science fiction epic , the fifth element's complex plot begins right away , in the deserts of egypt ( think stargate ) in 1914 .  an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the " 5 elements " are stored and takes them away , vowing to return them when the evil comes back .  cut to present day , which is our future .  the year is 2023 , and new york is the city .  the only basic differences between besson's futuristic depiction and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker , the buildings are higher , and the traffic floats !  anyway , the " evil " comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth , so back come the tortoise-like aliens to return the " 5 elements " to earth , in order to defend themselves against the " evil . "  in the process , however , the ship is intercepted by 2 fighter pods and is destroyed before landing .  when officials arrive at the site , all that remains is a hand .  what can you do with a hand ?  hey , its the 21st century here-dna reconstruction !  this hand turns out to belong to a beautiful , but mysterious woman named leeloo ( milla jovovich , dazed and confused ) .  she escapes and , attempting to escape the police by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper and crashing through the roof of korben's floating cab .  it's love at first site , as korben and leeloo elude the lazy-as-always cops .  when leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius ( ian holm , night falls on manhattan ) , korben searches the " yellow pages " and delivers her to the door of the good reverend , the only man who knows of her background and duties .  now , korben , leeloo , and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship ( special effects were spectacular here ) to find the remaining four elements .  it is here , where they discover that they have been followed by the evil jean-baptiste emmanuel zorg ( gary oldman , murder in the first ) .  he , too , wants possession of the elements , as do a group of pig-like warriors ( think the gamorreans in return of the jedi ) .  in a spectacular ending , with time running out , leeloo is faced with a problem-why should she save a people who live to destroy each other ?  the question is a good one , and one that could be pondered .  but enough of that .  when korben points out his love for her , leeloo is inclined to become the " 5th element " and save the world from total destruction .  the fifth element features good performances by willis and holm , an excellent portrayal of a comedic villain ( who reminded me a lot of jack nicholson's the joker in batman ) by one of the masters of villainy , oldman , and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich .  the supporting cast , which includes brion james ( tango & cash ) , tim " tiny " lester ( no holds barred ) , luke perry ( buffy the vampire slayer ) , and chris tucker ( friday ) , added a comedic effect to the film .  although besson's the fifth element can be criticized for the outlandish use of cliches , it is a solid motion picture with a definite point .  some other directors ( like anaconda's luis llosa ) should take a lesson from this guy-using ideas from epic motion pictures the right way .  ideas from star wars and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film .  sci-fi fan or not , any movie-lover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture .   ,  
0 a sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom .  there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out , its the kind of stuff i've seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny .  the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can't get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story .  pen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var's " all about my mother , " but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face .  the best you can say about her , is that she's not to blame for this picture being so off .  this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will .  the story is all about the love , motion sickness , and cooking ability of isabella ( cruz ) , who is born in bahia , brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents' cook .  to cure her motion sickness , her parents tried every remedy , until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure .  she is able to control it now as long as she doesn't drive a car , ride elevators , follow in dancing , and is the woman on top when making love .  in other words , she has to be in control of things .  in her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter , toninho oliveira ( murilo ben ? cio ) and marries him .  they open up a successful restaurant , where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it , even though he's a loafer .  one night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco .  we don't see her in flight , so i can't tell how she handled her motion sickness problem -- unless she flew the plane .  she visits her friend's apartment monica ( harold perrineau jr . ) , who is a cross-dresser , blending right into the san francisco scene .  to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho , she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell , freeing her from ever loving him again .  her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff ( mark feurerstein ) gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show .  you can really write the script from here on by yourself . . . as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had , but things continue to go bad for him : there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village , there is no chef to replace his wife , as the restaurant is about to close for good .  so he comes to san francisco , figuring he can charm her again .  he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians , the ones he used when courting her , when he serenaded her under her window .  he sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick , the yuppie tv producer chasing after her , and sees that she is no longer charmed by him .  when he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her , the ratings go up and he's hired as a regular on the show .  the show gets so big , that the network honchos come onboard , taking it national .  but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show , get rid of monica because he's a freak , have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses , and they change her ethnic dresses to low-cut vanna white type of sexy dresses .  cliff , her would-be boyfriend , acts creepy and sides with the network big-shots , even though he loved everything she did .  these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos , they were revolting .  it was an insult to one's intelligence .  i'm sure that i'm not spoiling the ending for anyone , when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again .  if the film wasn't terrible enough , monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers .  it was so awkwardly done , that it had no sense of truth or humor to it .  this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film , because it doesn't look or feel like an almod ? var film , the type of film it aspired to be , but more like a film that was interferred with from above .  its more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic , as it searches for box office heaven .  
0 i've never written a review for a movie i haven't watched all the way through , but i had to make an exception with powder .  i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend's house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house .  so i never got to finish the movie and i'm sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie .  but i can at least get a partial review out of it , because i saw enough to know this one wasn't worth finishing in the first place .  the movie centers around a freaky teenager who's spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents' house .  when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him ) , social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ?  gold bond ) to a state home , where we find out he's a different from the other kids .  actually , we find out he's different when we first see him , because he's the most pale individual we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever .  when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie , the father takes one look at him and says " he's not my son .

1 jamaica is a hot vacation spot .  the exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth ( approximately 30 jamaican dollars to one american ) , the sea is a brilliant blue , the air is warm but lacks humidity .  and as tourism is unfortunately jamaica's biggest trade , foreigners enter and leave with a sense of relaxation .  life and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country .  while normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music , this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface .  the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid .  it guides the audience along a tourist's journey and the story of the native inhabitants .  instead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen , it quips , " you don't see what happens after you flush the toilet . "  this engages a viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there .  this strong , sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film .  stephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals .  this isn't just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life .  people are interviewed from all sectors of occupation , from field to factory , as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country .  the variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer , whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not .  of course , as can be expected , the united states is slammed , owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank .  officials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica's economy will help the country back on its feet , but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word .  the next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed , usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the u . s . is forcing on the citizens .  admittedly , some of the back and forth between the business-minded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive , but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument .  but jamaica isn't against the united states , and this documentary does not accuse the u . s . of being the sole perpetrator of its grief .  if anything , it begs for a better understanding of the nature of jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations .  
0 a new entry in the " revisionist history " genre of filmmaking , dick suggests that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation's biggest presidential scandal .  kirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene's watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across g . gordon liddy ( played dead-on by harry shearer ) and the infamous break-in .  when they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip , they are ushered into a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as official presidential dog walkers .  the girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with .  when they discover that nixon ( another dead-on performance by dan hedaya , who actually favors nixon slightly , unlike anthony hopkins ) has been abusive to checkers , the presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they quit and become disillusioned .  during a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president's resignation .  this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king-type talk show ( featuring a cameo by french stewart ) about revealing the identity of " deep throat " .  from there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad " dick " joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy .  at one point , the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial .  the band manages to stop right as dunst screams " you have to stop letting dick run your life ! "  much to the horror of everyone standing within earshot .  several other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film .  if this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault it's juvenile bathroom humor , but it's not .  the film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience's throat in the least subtle way possible .  i don't recall oliver stone's nixon having to pander to it's audience , but of course that film wasn't a comedy aimed squarely at a 13-20 year-old film going audience .  the only redeeming thing about this movie is it's remarkable supporting cast .  i wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch's woodward and bernstein .  those two characters are the sole basis for my rating .  i wish they had been given more screen time , but unfortunately , they are only relegated to the final half-hour .  their constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight , especially mcculloch's constant thwarting of ferrell's attempts to gather information from the girls ( who , in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat , so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy's brother ) .  the other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters , but are given nothing to work with .  i'd like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities .  as for the two leads , dunst and williams can definitely do better .  they come off as what could best be described as romy and michele : the early years in this particular film , a highly dubious distinction at best .  stay through the first half of the end credits though , to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie .  an excellent idea marred by poor execution , dick could have been a great movie .  less of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes , could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds .  as it stands though , dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as " dick and poopie " jokes .  and that , to me , does not make a funny movie .

0 about an hour or so into " the jackal , " a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out " i hope she gets killed now ! "  at that point it hit me : i didn't care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn't really like .  when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he's being played by sidney poitier , you know something's rotten in the state of denmark .  every year , a couple films like this are released .  you know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago .  this was the third one of '97 , following the very lackluster " the saint , " which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun " the peacemaker , " featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain .   " the jackal " tries to mix both elements .  and you thought " the saint " was bad .   " the jackal " is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i've yet to see , " the day of the jackal , " which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule .  well , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . . . or  is he ?  after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he'll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion .  and like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people .  the agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from " romeo + juliet " ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of '97 ) who's in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever .  soon , he's out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him .  there are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on .  the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue .  sure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register .  the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one .  it doesn't help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances .  the script of " the jackal " is a complete mess , mostly because it can't decide what it wants to focus on .  is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ?  is it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who's in everything for the money ?  or is it a combination of both ?   " the jackal " aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character .  the connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast .  the worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then .  the supporting characters are worse .  sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable .  what is poitier doing here ?  he's one of the best living actors !  does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ?  diane venora's russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade .  it's not that anyone's bad here ; it's that they have nothing to do .  the plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time .  the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain .  there are several times where he's in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill .  take a scene where he's being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it .  doesn't killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ?  and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ?  geez !  is there anything good here ?  well . . . a  couple things .  i did like willis's icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle .  richard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have .  and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis .  but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they're just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is " the jackal . "  director michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior " rob roy " ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way .  every now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( " clear and present danger , " which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but " the jackal " is an example of when they go completely wrong .  
0 as bad as " mimic " was , it definitly scared me .   " mimic " continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style , and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie .  director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film " cronos . "  that movie worked because it took an unconventional story , unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie .  in " mimic " , del toro doesn't bother to give us anything original .  the plot is a stupid combination of " aliens " meets " species " meets " jurassic park . "  the characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies .  there's nothing new in " mimic " .  it's just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work .  at the end of the movie , you're stuck wanting your money back .  maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies : he forgot to turn the lights on .  i don't understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the " seven " trend and be set in dark , dank areas .  watching " mimic " i was tempted several times to yell at the screen " turn the lights on !  the switch is to your right !  use common sense !  just do it !  you'll be able to see the monster in the corner ! "  there's a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off .  it looked like the light operator was having a seizure , and sorvino didn't even notice - she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts .   " hmmm . . . .  i think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight . "   " mimic " has a lot of incidental shock tactics ( boo !  just kidding ! ) and follows them up with the real scare , but nothing in this movie scares you .  the audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments ; i think they were bored , too .  i shouldn't blame del toro .  he isn't the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie .  hong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time , " the killer " and " hard boiled " then came to america to make the stupid " broken arrow . "  french directors luc besson ( " la femme nikita " ) and george sluizer ( " the vanishing " ) followed woo's lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies .  robert rodriguez , who directed the terrific low budget " el mariachi " came to hollywood and directed the horrible , high-budget " desperado . "  i don't know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country can't make a good american movie .  woo finally broke through and made " face/off " , but it still isn't up to par with his earlier films .  i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office , chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director , " welcome to america !  i bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long .  do you speak english ?  now , i know you think you've made good movies in the past , but now you're in america , so things are a little different here .  just remember what the american audience always wants , and you'll be fine .  they want to see at least one big breasted woman , characters that they've seen a thousand times before ( because change scares americans ) , and you always need a cheesy feel-good ending to wrap things up .  if you don't make that kind of movie , you'll be shining my shoes in no time . "  
0 well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task .  he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films .  in a domain that he owns , it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script from a bad one .  eraser , back in 1996 , was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense .  batman and robin , in 1997 , was the black sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting , idiotic action scenes , and painfully flashy costumes .  now in 1999 , " end of days " ( not " the end of days " ) is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold .  is this the end of a powerful action star's long-lived career ?  will arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past ( " terminator " , " terminator 2 : judgement day " , " predator " ) ?  or an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in the past ( " commando " , " red sonja " , " true lies " ) ?  it doesn't look that way .   " end of days " begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably , due to the formation of the stars on that night , will be the carrier of satan's baby the hour before new year's of 2000 .  fortunately for the movie's sake , the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers , subway trains in dark tunnels , and a myriad of inept nypd officers .  it's an action film's dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up .  imagine if the girl had lived in anytown , usa , where the only thing to destroy is a dairy queen and a post office .  arnold schwarzenegger ( jericho cane ) , in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church , who is trying to hide the girl ( or in some cases trying to kill her ) , and satan ( gabriel byrne ) who is trying to make her pregnant .  if the devil is successful , the world will no longer exist as we know it .  jericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1 ) he once had faith but no longer does and 2 ) his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it .  jericho cane is your cliched , by-the-numbers hero right up to his name .  arnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can .  he shouts at everyone , from cops to priests , to the devil .  in one truly hilarious scene , which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point , jericho screams to the devil ; " you are a @#$^% ! &  choir boy !  you are a choir boy ! "  those two lines marked the high points of this film .  a movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor .   " end of days " fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne .  byrne , playing a man who has been made the manifestation of the devil , seems to be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie .  he wonderfully plays a manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time .  the annoying thing about his character , however , is that he has the power to kill any human with a simple punch in the face , yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho .  i can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody .  the other actors in the film give very weak and unconvincing performances .  kevin pollak , who plays the partner and close friend of jericho , is the supposedly funny character in the film ( every action movie has one ) .  the one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line .  robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan's baby with extreme annoyance .  she gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the film , except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter , or any of the viewers in the audience .  in one unnecessary scene , tunney walks out of her room and takes her top off .  is this her job in the film ?  the actors are not to blame entirely because the script is terrible .  you can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen minutes before it does .  this little prediction game is a very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of a movie .  in a last attempt to make this movie good , special effects are used to try to entertain the audience .  but without a memorable action scene in the whole film , the director has not done his job successfully .  this film would have gotten a c+ if arnold stood in front of a camera and shouted " you are a ! $@^@ * ^  choir boy ! ! "  for two hours .  
1 although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama 'the sopranos , ' analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it's own right .  billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol , who new 'patient' happens to be gangster boss paul vitti ( de niro . )  ben wants nothing to do with vitti , as he's about to get married to laura macnamara ( kudrow ) and having a gangster as a patient wouldn't really help .  but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds , and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out .  all done in a comic fashion , of course .  although never brilliant , analyze this is also never rubbish , which makes for a fun ride .  billy crystal , who hasn't had a good role since city slickers way back in the early '90's , is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act .  he's pretty funny while he does it , and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers , he's pretty funny .  robert de niro is hilarious as vitti , playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny .  he's a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine .  lisa kudrow , barely seen as crystals' estranged wife to be , basically reprises her phoebe role from t . v series friends , which is getting rather tiresome , and doesn't come off well on the screen .  the supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas , and are all funny caricatures , especially vitti's bodyguard jelly ( joe viterelli . )  the film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie , but with laughs instead of hard ass talking .  it sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film , but it strangely fits in .  spoofs are made of famous gangster movies , including a nice parody of the godfather .  the italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun .  there's also some odd plot points : fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason .  it is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history , and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script .  unfortunately , this is hollywood , so we will never know .  harold ramis , best known as egon from ghostbusters , has a deft touch with directing comedy , as shown in the immortal groundhog day , and the less immortal caddyshack .  all the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience .  the script , written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan , starts off funny , remains funny for the most of the film , but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory .  the film is short , however , and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll .  analyze this is a good comedy , and is certainly worth watching .  robert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it , even though it does seem forced , or like a parody ( although i think this was intentional . )  crystal is his most likeable in years , kudrow is given as little screen time as possible , which is a good thing , and de niro is just awesome .  it's no goodfellas , and it probably won't be remembered as much as groundhog day , but analyze this is a well done comedy that won't leave you feel cheated .  
0 according to popular film opinion , a film's greatness is determined by time .  take for example " casablanca . "  great film , even today .  it's still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic .  another example would be " star wars , " which had a very , very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before .  but as i rewatched " independence day " when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 , i kinda felt like it wasn't as cool as when i had first seen it .  i had liked it when i saw it the first time ( * * * was my original view ) and basically saw it as a good " escape film . "  but when i rewatched it , i felt cheated .  thus , the curse of the " event film . "   " independence day " is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once ( except for a couple kids - the critics , in this situation ) .  but after a while , this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one .  well , this kid is the " event film " in my little analogy .  and when i rewatched " independence day , " not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen , but i felt insulted the whole time .  there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren't sure if it's comedy or hokey drama .  one scene , you'll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch ; the next you'll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around , saying corny lines .  the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of " glen or glenda ? "  now this annoying kid's problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once , he shows he has no balls .  and " independence day " has no balls .  it plays it safe everywhere .  it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films .  the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of " star wars . "  i mean , isn't that devil's den ?  and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore's breasts in " striptease . "  they're these octopus men , boring freaking octopus men .  i mean , come on .  the aliens in " 2001 " were more interesting and you didn't even see them !  basically the plot is straight from a b-movie from the 50s : aliens come to earth and we wonder if they're hostile or peaceful .  okay , it's an interesting topic , but it's not handled greatly .  now they aren't and somehow a computer geek , jeff goldblum , figure out they're using our satellites as a countdown to destruction .  yep .  these aliens are not only heavily armed , they're stupid too .  they also use the same kind of computer as we do , but that comes about later .  the president ( bill pullman ) , who's under attack for being a wimp , decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent , and he decides he'll stay in the white house which the aliens have covered .  i don't care if it's bob freaking dole in the white house , get him out of there .  i don't care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol , just get him out of there .  later on , he's stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship .  i think it's time for impeachment for this guy .  he's more senile than reagan on pot .  then there's a cocky pilot ( will smith ) who is the only person to survive the counter-attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51 ( the film's only sign of being brave ) .  his girlfriend's a stripper sharing a subplot with " striptease " in that she has to do it for her son .  come on , she has a fighter pilot boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance .  i think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers .  she's also the few , the proud , the lucky to survive the igniting of l . a . ( as well as her dog , who narrowly survives ) .  there are some bright spots .  they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing .  the best one is when jeff goldblum ( nicely named david ) turns on his computer and a picture of hal comes up and says , " good morning , dave . "  and they even played r . e . m . 's   " it's the end of the world as we know it ( and i feel fine ) at the beginning .  and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great ( he's a stereotype , but i just loved the man anyway ) .  but there are no real subtle comic moments .  will gets way too many one-liners and he has no one to play off of ( execept jeff towards the end , and the two do great ) .  as i said , this film has no balls .  it is just aiming for a crowd pleaser and that's what it is .  but after a couple months , we all move on to the next " event " film while intaking little films and a couple indy ones for good measure .  but at least the indy ones last for a lifetime .  this one's short on batteries .  
1 life is beautiful is a rare treat : a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful , or , even worse , humorless .  it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce , stirs in a little poignancy , and ends up a very enjoyable movie .  it's an italian film , but don't let that discourage you .  subtitle-phobes will be missing a wonderful experience .  life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy , with the clownish , but good natured guido ( roberto benigni ) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle .  the year is 1939 , and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams , dora ( nicoletta braschi ) .  their romance seems to be picture perfect , with only one stumbling block : she's already engaged to another man .  can guido overcome the odds and win his girl ?  what do you think ?  however , five years later , things have taken a turn for the worse in italy .  the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives , which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue ( giorgio cantarini ) , who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp .  unable to protect his boy in any other way , guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp .  he pretends that everything is all an elaborate game , with points awarded for such tasks as hiding , being brave and being very very quiet .  as you can tell from the description , life is beautiful has two very different tones , but manages to excel at both of them .  as a romantic comedy , it is sweet and funny .  as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair , it is touching .  roberto benigni's work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin's , and it is easy to see why .  he is able to run the gamut of comic expression , from slapstick to farce , with a warm-hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero's " triumph of the underdog " spirit .  life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust .  however , it is able to successfully navigate the minefield , without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears .  with life is beautiful , benigni has created a triumphant , but bittersweet comedy .  it's quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i've had at the movies this year .  
1 all those who were offended by there's something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch .  and while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end .  american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season .  i must question the studio that releases a movie like this .  the producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film .  some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie .  american pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r . but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park .  it is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny .  american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night .  jim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead .  jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie . . . ' .  of course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner .  there are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief .  american pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it .  i loved the young cast in this movie .  consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances .  biggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise .  but in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television's sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim's uneasy father .  scenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie .  after levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age .  but i never used baked goods . '  it is performances such as his , and bill murray's in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out .  there are some less-than-original aspects of the film .  a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we've seen before .  if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother's dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect .  secondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing .  but at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it's own , biggs asks his buddies why he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very important anyway . '  and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature .  in it's own way .  
1 when i left the theater after seeing david lynch's " lost highway , " i remarked to a fellow movie-goer , " i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears . "  in his first feature film in five years , lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture " eraserhead " on the weirdness scale .  you won't " know " what happened when it's over , though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses .  it is difficult to describe the plot of this film , because it depends partly on how you interpret it .  i can , however , describe what we see on the screen : l . a . jazz saxophonist fred madison ( bill pullman ) and his wife renee ( patricia arquette ) , whom he clearly suspects of infidelity , receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep .  they are , naturally enough , more than a little frightened and confused , and it doesn't help matters any when " mystery man " ( robert blake ) approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons' house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving .  the next morning , fred finds another videotape which , to his ( and our ) surprise , shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom .  he is convicted of her murder and sent to death row , where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton ( balthazar getty ) .  the perplexed prison officials release dayton , whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways - most notably his affair with alice wakefield ( arquette again ) , a blonde who is otherwise renee's spitting image , and another encounter with the mystery man .  i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more , but suffice it to say that lynch doesn't offer any neat wrap ? ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of " lost highway " are out in full force from beginning to end .  this description might make " lost highway " sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch's weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time .  on the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch's previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther .  the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery .  there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings-on here .  we , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred's , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent .  all of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch's typically slow-paced , idiosyncratic style .  as is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in " lost highway " it works perfectly .  there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred's blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil's " song to the siren " can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically " happening " in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity .  lynch's direction and director of photography pete deming's darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story .  well , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer's attention because of its tie-ins to the original mystery .  the main characters in this " reality " - dayton ( a well-meaning but none too intelligent 24-year-old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn-star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you couldn't find in any of the two dozen " pulp fiction " wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film's spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch .  lynch's typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here .  it's not exactly exploitative - like almost everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off .  that said , these minor flaws don't prevent " lost highway " from attaining its place as one of the darkest , most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years .  it is a one-way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind , and as such it is gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective .  
0 paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i'd consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who's managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils .  starship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that's nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage .  it's not a completely successful film , but as a failure it's certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one .  my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven't yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ) .  i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that's as touching as schwarzenegger's in t2 .  that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics .  its violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience .  there's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him .  he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim's every fearful tic .  it's a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir .  in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won't shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on .  but why ?  his character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who's always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster .  the kind who just won't die .  hollow man's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who's saddled with the film's worst lines ( " i've lost cohesion again ! " ) .  they're a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w . bush's republican national convention speech ( i . e .  bush referring to clinton ; " ? ? ? so much promise ? ? ? but to what end ?  to what end ? " --  this actually got applause !  suddenly warren beatty doesn't look so absurd ) .  the rest of the film's characters are all well past thirty , though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners ; is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood's new character developing technique ?  ahh , what a cynical time we live in ? ? ?  as the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation's ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at ) .  they've performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine , in a twist worthy of the film's 1950's late show origins , to impulsively experiment on himself .  caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead .  our mad scientist is turned invisible ( after several fx-heavy complications ) , then he inexplicably ( it's hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures , but this is never explored , and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? )  begins raping , assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases , always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger .  it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it's verhoeven's films that have become hollow .  like the rest , this one is cold , heartless , and full of contempt for humanity , but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit , insight and makes no statement other than " audiences will pay for anything these days " .  it's an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level , or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun , thrill-a-minute ride .  verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care .  the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick .  how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self ?  a couple weeks ago , after seeing the trailer , a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability .  hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot .  but oh yeah , it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway .  verhoeven delivers the sleazy " goods " , but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner , here it just feels icky and uncomfortable .  the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses , caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux-psycho music strains in the background .  it's plainly obvious that verhoeven isn't exploring voyeurism ( like in the classic peeping tom ) but exploiting it and not even doing that very well .  it's funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman's naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand .  most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks .  in fact it's largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since , by the end , most of his potential victims don infer-red glasses that track his body heat .  as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov ( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre ) , and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked .  the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy .  it happens when a lab assistant ( kim dickens , who looks like she stepped out of playboy ) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon , suddenly pauses .   " are you looking at me ? " , she queries , obviously haunted .  it's a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 ( the apex of the mad slasher craze ) .  those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer .  and they're the only reason to check out hollow man , preferably as a mid-week bargain rental .  you've been warned .  but you probably won't listen , will you ?  tis' a pity ? ? ?  
0 i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on .  i'm big fan of perry's subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley's on-edge , extreme acting was a riot .  so naturally , when the trailer for " almost heroes " hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down .  a soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley's final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry's big breakthrough .  i was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley's best , in spite of david spade's absence .  i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran .  sadly , none of this came to pass .  the humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one-liners few and far between .  perry and farley have no chemistry ; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it's his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with .  and the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it's a farley flick .  the movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second .  perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly ; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley .  and farley's classic humor is widespread , too .  almost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon-train by quite a longshot .  guys , let's leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ?  stick to " tommy boy " , and we'll all be " friends " .  
0 a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings .  family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail .  still , i can't recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love .  and after it , i still can't .  bye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare .  only a few moments which have nothing to do with the film's main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion .  bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children .  dave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul-humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex-wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku ) .  over the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic's blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny's growing estrangement from emma .  the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality .  randy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening .  his run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is gimmicky and implausible .  he does get bye bye love's best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn .  paul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy " mad about you " persona , but he does it well .  as a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here .  matthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible .  this isn't a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it .  modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it's all his father's fault he's such a cad .  carolco's executives , whose entire future is resting on modine's bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now .  bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another " dating in the 90s " movie .  when the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not .  even more confusing is a sub-plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald's and befriends a troubled youth .  it is a sad end to flanders' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald's as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser .  even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children .  any way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue .  it is left to the dads' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn't enough .  there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching .  bye bye love is a genuine shame .  
0  " american pie " alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summer's attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute couple-ness and zany comedy .  it's about an a+ student ( biggs as " paul " ) who gets a scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for dora ( suvari ) a ditzy heroin-chic goth chick who has no ambition or self-respect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like " hick-boy " paul is .  so we've got a fish-out-water formula mixed with meet-cute romantic comedy which ideally should make for a good movie .  unfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring direction by " clueless " auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything about the film .  these characters are totally unrealistic and unbelievable - it's as if everyone under age 30 is a stoned raver .  there's no background or details to anyone or anything , it's just a bunch of cartoon characters running into each other .  not to mention the story itself which is virtually non-existant and contains so many plotholes it's like swiss cheese .  even the basic editing is bad .  if you're looking for a romantic comedy stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny .  i saw this in a packed cinema on opening night and the audience barely laughed at all .  if you've seen the commericials you've seen all the " funny " parts ( which are all from the first five minutes ) .  
1  " being john malkovich " is the type of film we need to see more .  today's films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas , or those that have similar themes .  malkovich falls under none of these categories , and it's quite refreshing to see that occur .  this strangely provoking story , is actually somewhat understandable .  john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time .  his wife ( cameron diaz ) supports the both of them by working at a petstore , which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment .  when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job , he finds an ad for a filing clerk .  when he reaches the building , he arrives at a 7 1/2 floor .  it's there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time .  meanwhile , cusack meets a business partner ( catherine keener ) , in which he falls madly in love with her .  the only problem is , she has no interest in him what so ever .  the whole portal thing , isn't just a toy , in fact , it becomes cusack's dream .  being inside malkovich's mind , gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich , like a puppet , and to fulfill his fantasies .  i don't want to give away too much , but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery .  in my opinion , this idea is absolutely brilliant .  it's really quite scary to think that someone could become you , control you , be you .  it makes you wonder why we act like we do , and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue .  even if the script is super sharp , i can't help but find the ending displeasing .  it could have lead up to something more , or at least an amusing conclusion .  it tried to explain a mythology about the portals , that made it seem rushed .  other than that , i had a very enjoyable time .  the acting was quite delightful as well .  john cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability , and he does it well .  he's by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity , but i'm hoping that will change .  cameron diaz was her usual charming self , although i felt that part was wrong for her , but she pulled it off .  john malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice .  who else's mind would be better to explore ?  the director , spike jonze , who appeared in last month's three kings really catches my attention with this project .  i knew he was bizzare , but not to this extreme .  he too is likely too receive media attention .   " being john malkovich " isn't an excellent film , but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite .  what's even better is the film's puzzling message . . . am  i nick lyons ?  
1 logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility .  considering that the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task .  occasionally , we get a film that does manage it .  terry gilliam's " 12 monkeys " was one such film .  but more frequently , we get films that don't much deal with it at all .  there is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ?  the " terminator " films made up for them with exciting action , " back to the future " did it with an entertaining story , and the new film " frequency " pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own .  is " frequency " filled with plot holes ?  yes .  does it matter ?  not really .  the film opens in october of 1969 .  firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) .  the double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective .  a strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in '69 and that john has found in the present day .  though both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom .  now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women .  frank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past .  the premise of " frequency " is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions .  this isn't explained ; you just have to go with it .  when frank doesn't die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way .  the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other .  sometimes frank's changing the past results in something happening right away in john's world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time .  now , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer's murders was because the change had already happened in frank's world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren't really the point .  when " frequency " gets cooking , it's a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing .  what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and " frequency " works as long as it keeps moving .  the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion .  director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure " frequency " as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved .  i liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward .  it actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john's advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him .   ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . )  i even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods .  some may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let's face it : it's a darn cool way to end the film .  there are enough surprises and plot twists in " frequency " to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant .  the other major thing to appreciate about " frequency " is the handling of the father-son relationship .  quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it's a rock-solid job from both actors .  the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ?  watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question .  the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don't believe in the characters , we don't care about the outcome of the thriller plot .  here , we do care , because we like the lead actors .  i also liked some of the supporting cast members .  elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably .  andre braugher , late of the television show " homicide : life on the street , " gives a nice supporting turn as frank's best friend and future colleague of john .  he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank's world series predictions come true before his very eyes .  braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused .  perhaps the only thing i didn't like about " frequency " is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera's focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard .  but that's only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics .  i freely acknowledge that " frequency " may best work as a " guy " movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of " field of dreams " can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable .  who wouldn't want to speak with a long-dead parent ?  or see how their children turn out ?   " tell me about your life , son " -- excuse me while i mist up .  and don't call me a sissy .  
0 fit for a ghoul's night out , fat girl stands cast iron firm with the simplistic , fatuous , built-in excuse that its woman director is baring the harsh sexual realities of adolescent girls .  being a boy , i might not understand female behavior and am unequipped to analyze this particular pseudo-feminist coming-of-age story .  fair enough .  i'll pretend to ignore the mannered posturing and health class 101 " this is a no-no " dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass , speaking variations on " it won't hurt ! "  for a scene that seems to last at least ten minutes .  this is done almost entirely in an unbroken master shot that suggests unimaginative camerawork more than unblinking voyeurism .  they dare you to look away , without possessing the courage of allowing the children to actually sound like children ( they're mouthpieces for writer-director catherine breillat's one-note clinical politics ) .  rather than show an even-handed evaluation of the rigors of hormonal change , breillat ( previously responsible for the unwatchable romance ) wants to indulge in her hour of hate .  life is pain , highness .  get used to it .  she'd find keen bedfellows in neil labute and todd solondz , other sultans of misanthropy who lack the balls to be earnest or honest .  for children , dealing with trauma and pain is complicated .  to bury that in sarcasm and academic theory feels cheap .  these would-be auteurs ( more like hauteurs ) haven't earned the right to display suffering because they don't layer it in emotional truth ( as mike leigh does throughout naked and david lynch in several key scenes of blue velvet ) .  of course , there i go again comparing her to all these ( better ) male directors .  i don't care .  gender be damned , she's borderline inept .  braced for a knee-jerk reaction from the art house crowd ( mortified shock or compulsory applause will suffice ) , writer-director catherine breillat may well accomplish her mission to get a rise out of people .  don't be fooled .  this grotesque oversimplification of awkward forays into passion may be quickly forgotten , remembered only as cold , boring , philosophically arid , and incompetently photographed .  the hyperviolent climactic sequence proves so extraordinarily misguided that i honestly wondered whether breillat had thrown in an impromptu dream sequence .  twelve years old , a bundle of dough with a sour pout , the superb ana ? s reboux plays the titular fat girl with a thousand yard stare and a frumpy insouciance .   ( her character is also named ana ? s . )  sitting at the table morosely slurping down a banana split , her presence is grounded and heartbreaking .  it's a pity breillat never finds anything for her to do other than get defensive against her evil storybook sister , 15-year old elena ( roxane mesquida ) , for bringing a transitory boyfriend home to their shared room .  in this summer cottage , ana ? s has no escape from her position as stoic bedside observer to elena's depressing confusion of cheap sex with romance .  the boy in question , a smug italian college kid named fernando ( libero de rienzo ) is a real piece of work , claiming that the experience is a declaration of love while begging for a blowjob .  ana ? s doesn't receive any warmth from her largely absent parents , who join elena in making fun of her hefty girth .  she finds pleasure in wandering the beach alone , singing songs to herself , and swimming in the pool kissing the metal railing and pretending that it's her paramour .  reboux commands the screen , but there's only so much a child actress can do recounting pretentious monologues to herself .  if one is inspired to rescue this young performer and place her in a better movie , at least she fares better than the other young talent asked to perform in intense love scenes that might feel justified if they weren't so dramatically misguided .  this 83-minute vignette is something of a horror show , but breillat saves her nastiest poison for the very end .  on the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members , gigantic trucks swerve by as the hour grows late .  will mommy fall asleep at the wheel ?  perhaps .  or maybe there's something deadlier around the corner , lying in wait to pounce upon the unsuspecting fat girl .  what's more , she might even like it .  with the intent of being unfair and unpredictable , placing her heroine in the most diabolical of corners in order to face up to impending adulthood , breillat's extreme flourish of sadistic tawdriness reveals her as a master purveyor of contempt .  fat girl is a bitter pill indeed .  aka ? ma soeur !  screened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) .  
1 in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she'll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they'll most enjoy .  some scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before .  this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat's true colors begin to shine through .  making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year .  what gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom's 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what's on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences .  the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness .  chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion .  the bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens .  many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne's opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business .  on the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne's shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does .  also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends .  juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character's determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat's success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses .  lena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs .  judi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin .  carrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously .  victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down .  a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : " five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . "  that's not to say the men don't do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne .  the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film .  cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman's masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules .  chocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter .  while not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale .  and it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward .  the bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure .  
0 deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie .  this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises , and , being true to its title , being deceptive .  but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit .  braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute ( renee zellweger ) .  their lone suspect is wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker's pocket .  however , a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators , as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables .  braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives .  braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook ( ellen burstyn ) , a local bookie .  kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite ( rosanna arquette ) , believing his wife to be unfaithful .  the plot is twisty and complex , with lots of lengthy flashbacks , and plenty of surprises .  however , there are times when it is needlessly complex , and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost .  take a look at l . a . confidential , or the film's more likely inspiration , the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled .  the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot .  for example , the film tells a few substories ( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender , or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear ) , but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable .  there's never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation .  they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay .  the characters , themselves , are rather pathetic and despicable .  not one of them is an ounce sympathetic , and as a result , the labyrinthine plot is all for naught .  what does it matter who is guilty of what and why ?  writer-directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers' masterwork blood simple , or the wachowski brothers' less worthy bound .  but , while they have got the plot twists down cold , they need to work on characterization and dialogue .  
1 hollywood has a . 750  batting average with elmore leonard adaptations .  last year's touch was ill-conceived and just plain odd but get shorty , jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies .  steven soderburgh , master of sex , lies and videotape , now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery , prison , double-crossing , uncut diamonds and , oh yeah , true love .  george clooney is the protagonist , a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker , but for once i didn't want to slap the taste out of his mouth .  he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant-type perfected in hitchcock movies , the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other .  nowhere present is clooney's usual ain't-i-sexy sneer -- there's just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style .  clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty .  clooney plays a man who's robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun .  in the opening scene , he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm .  of course , he gets caught , so it's not all good .  it's while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate's ( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig ) collection of diamonds in detroit .  clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score , while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans .  meanwhile , there's jennifer lopez .  unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda , she's finally graduated to a worthy role as the u . s . marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes .  rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car , and lopez makes it a threesome , her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney .  he's covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck , and it's a little cramped in there , but they manage to make a love connection anyway , probably because it's a movie .  the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie , and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir-ish crime story .  the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime , and this is no exception .  although they're not really germane to the plot , lopez's relationship with her father ( dennis farina of get shorty ) , rhames' relationship with his christian sister ( you could call her sister christian ) and a pop-in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it .  out of sight spans at least three years but has a non-linear structure , focusing on the jailbreak / brooks score and flashing back to earlier times .  this is a movie with a brain , as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves .  the entire cast does the material justice -- clooney and lopez coming into their own , and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites .  here's hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch .  serving america for almost 1/20th of a century !  
1 why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ?  too many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues .   " the iron giant , " which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as " the simpsons " and " king of the hill , " assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time .   " the iron giant " holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike .  hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine .  after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception .  he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food .  after saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts .  because of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy .  realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time .  it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security .  he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger .  meanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind .   " the iron giant " is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience .  the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy .  it's very similar to the spielberg classic " e . t . , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of " the iron giant . "  the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy .  the film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate .  hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero .  the final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed .  the animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after " tarzan " ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon .  the giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way .  the characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief .  fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother .  harry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's " frasier " ) as an army general called in by agent mansley .  unlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched ) .  dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations .  even the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia .  a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but " the iron giant " has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off .  the film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though .  it's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy .  the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on " the simpsons " for many years .  a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to " outlast " one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever .  the film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to " duck and cover " in the event of a nuclear attack .   " the iron giant " has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing .  instead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with .  when you get right down to it , " the iron giant " is no more than the story of a boy and his robot .  the story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming .  though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go .  it's akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it's not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which " the iron giant " has in spades .  
0 let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official ( and even unofficial ) james bond series .  it is so full of self-parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof .  an omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence , a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it's difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie ) and the assassin of the title .  a song with woefully terrible lyrics follows , and the rest of the movie is even worse .  the plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule-the-world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s , but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin , francisco scaramanga ( christopher lee , putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie ) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore's 007 .  there is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis and a missing solar cell with 95% efficiency .  it's as much of a mess as it sounds .  bond is " helped " in his task by mary goodnight ( ekland ) , whose character couldn't possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo .  during the course of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk , blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever .  maud adams ( later to star in octopussy ) is a much more stronger and useful character , but she hardly features in the movie .  scaramanga's lackey is a dwarf called nik-nak , who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series , serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures .  worse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie .  there is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in ( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists -- another misguided attempt at humour ) .  the solitary car chase might have been a highlight , but the " action " is interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff ( j . w .  pepper , played by clifton james of live and let die " fame " ) yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window .  he is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie .  even his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history , a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge -- could have been , except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print .  on top of that debacle , the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga's " funhouse " .  the only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series ( the infinitely superior " the spy who loved me " ) a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive .  
0 the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress .  that's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized , all-encompassing plot .  such an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment .  one need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent .  the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist .  you will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less .  those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one-note dud that is big momma's house .  others will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness .  lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner , an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john ( paul giamatti ) .  dangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco ( terrence howard ) has escaped from prison , and the feds think he's headed for his former girlfriend and presumed-but-never-proved accomplice sherry ( nia long ) .  sherry , however , has fled with her son trent ( jascha washington ) , possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ( ella mitchell ) , better known as big momma .  indeed , sherry appears to be on her way , but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming .  that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows .  big momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs .  doubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman .  unfortunately , big momma's house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters .  suspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other .  of course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma's house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny .  and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul-tempered beast , while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry .  unfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma's explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) .  martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character .  he's just big momma without the makeup on .  i won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film-makers .  there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) .  i'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way .  the gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs .  its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant .  big momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny .  it's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress .  
1 there's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did .   " lucky numbers " is a perfect example of this because it's such a blatant rip-off of " fargo " and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me .  i know i'm in the minority here but let me explain .  the film takes place in harrisburg , pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter .  john travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards .  russ is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ) , a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema .  she's a selfish , nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl - not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market .  crystal's cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ( ed o'neil ) , the tv station manager .  she doesn't seem to genuinely like either of them , but it's all she can do in this one-horse town .  much like " fargo , " this movie tells the story of a man who's going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick .  he enlists the help of his english friend gig ( tim roth ) , the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery .  along the way a subplot involving a two-bit thug named , accurately , " dale the thug " ( michael rappaport ) gets mixed up in the process .  there's also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down .  i'm not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you're not expecting .  this is a farce , which is basically a straightforward , adult-oriented comedy but doesn't go as far as a classic black comedy should .  where as " fargo " was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny , " lucky numbers " is just funny because you can't take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously .  it's all a big cartoon basically , but it's funny and i can respect that .  travolta is great in his role and even though he's not a really likable character , he's trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he's a creep .  he's like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill .  crystal is just the opposite , she's constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself .  kudrow is perfect in this role since she's spent 8 years on tv as the dim-witted phoebe on " friends . "  here is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe .  i have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money .  like " jackie brown , " ( an elmore leonard adaption ) , the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally .  the screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus .  more and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic , cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do .  the ending itself is great .  it's surprising and funny and makes you feel good .  you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies' worth of stories into two hours' time and didn't fall apart ( although many other critics might beg to differ ) .  i liked it , and i could see it again - isn't that what makes a movie good ?  
1 that thing you do ! , from first-time film director tom hanks , is an enjoyable tale about a fictional band , the wonders , that goes from a garage band to the band with the fastest selling album in the country .  but , the question arrises , will the seduction of fame and fortune corrupt the band and lead them to become just another one-hit wonder , or will they stick together and become the next teen sensations ?  the " oneders " , as they are originally known , have their first gig at a very small-time contest .  jimmy , the lead singer , has written a catchy song and intends to play it at the contest .  but , a short time before the contest begins , the current drummer becomes injured and a replacement is needed .  enter guy patterson , skilled musician who currently works at his father's appliance store and is looking to break free from the restricting clutches that bind him .  he seems to fit in well , until the group takes the stage .  when they begin to play , guy's beat is much too fast and the pace is way off for the intended song .  it looks as though the group is doomed to failure .  but , the " new " song is a hit !  this leads to another gig , and soon enough , the group has an agent .  he doesn't do too much for them , but they do get their song played on the radio .  eventually , mr . white of playtone records approaches the group , and he informs them that they want to release a record .  before you can say " billboard " , the band is now renamed " the wonders " and the members are speeding their way to fame .  the gigs are getting better , their fame is increasing , and they have the fastest selling album in playtone records history .  the band is invited to appear in a feature film , and , they then fly out to hollywood to appear on television .  after the appearance on television , things start to fall apart .  two of the members of the band pretty much disappear , and things are not working out well between jimmy and guy .  will the band work it out , or will they split up and go on their own separate journeys towards success ?  that thing you do ! , complete with a nifty original song that actually sounded authentic , is a fun and enjoyable movie that , although it doesn't become clear if it wants to be a comedy , drama , or romance , is a well-made look into the world of music .  tom hanks' directorial debut was a good one and should lead to more work for him .  
0 boy , what a great movie ! !  keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together , the director of the fugitive ( andrew davis ) back again to give us another thriller , and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot .  how could this not be a blockbuster ?  all die-hard keanu reeves fans , read on .  ol " much ado about nothing " plays eddie kasalivich , a machinist studying at the university of chicago .  to help pay for the rent , he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university .  by happy coincidence , he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics .  this project holds great promise : taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in .  a potential solution to the earth's energy problems without the pollution cost .  surely nobody could have any problems with that ?  morgan freeman is paul shannon , the project's sponsor .  he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public .  he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly .  so he murders the project leader , blows up the project ( great but short scene here , sort of like a mini id4 city-devastation thing ) and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi-tech hush-hush location .  unfortunately , our intrepid machinist and an english physicist ( weisz ) manage to get away and now follows a fugitive-like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script .  this movie is just dying for a comparison with " the fugitive " .  both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn't change much , i guess we can't really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere .  the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones , chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward .  credit to them , but we aren't really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters .  where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy , eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves' character is never given the time to develop .  it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences , which frankly , get quite boring after a while .  harrison ford was " the man against the world . "  he was alone in a world where he didn't know who to trust and it came across real well .  in chain reaction , keanu reeves isn't alone .  now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia , vulnerability and confusion .  we don't get this .  we get him thinking he's still in speed , only now our sandra bullock has an english accent , probably doesn't drive a bus , and hardly contributes anything to the movie .  the producers here probably thought , " hey , what if keanu and rachel don't hit it off too well ?  let's rope in that morgan to help us out . "  well , keanu and rachel didn't hit it off well on the screen , and most unfortunately , morgan freeman doesn't help much either .  the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder .  it's not really his fault .  once again , andrew davis just doesn't take the time to build his characters .  someone must have convinced him that this time round , cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  
1 if you want some hearty laughs , then rat race is the movie for you .  this unpretentious little comedy , which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype , will have you bouncing in your theater seat .  and while the film fits neatly into the low-brow , slapstick school of comedy , one refreshing aspect is its lack of mean-spiritedness .  the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner ( john cleese ) who must race from vegas to a bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city , n . m .  inside the locker is a duffel bag containing $2 million .  the first one to open the locker , gets the bag and the money .  what the group of participants doesn't know is that cleese's donald sinclair ( " i can do anything i want - i'm eccentric ! " ) is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel .  the participants include vera ( whoopi goldberg ) and merrill ( lanai chapman ) , a newly reunited mother and daughter ; disgraced pro football referee owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) ; italian tourist mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) ; randy pear ( jon lovitz ) and his family ; the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody ( seth green and vince vieluf ) ; and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) .  various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city .  screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another .  the most side-splitting situations involve vera and merrill's encounter with the squirrel lady , a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates ; owen's commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look-alikes on their way to a lucy convention ; the cody brothers misadventures with a hot-air balloon , a flying cow and a monster truck ; and the pear family's stopover at a barbie museum , which turns out not to be what they think it is .  the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman's script builds the laughs .  without going into detail , this bit segues from the museum to hitler's touring car , to eva braun's dark lipstick , to lovitz burning his tongue , culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans .  rat race's cast is first rate .  cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap ; lovitz is , at first , a bit whiny , but his character grows on you ; gooding is having a fine romp ; and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese's deadpan assistant , a man " born without a personality . "  the film is directed by jerry zucker , who knows something about comedy .  along with his brother , david , and friend jim abrahams , he was responsible for such hits as airplane !  and ruthless people .  a throwaway subplot , which is good for some laughs , features cleese and his buddies , betting on a series of outlandish situations , including one dealing with a hooker and pepto-bismol .  this is a fun little feature .  the only letdown comes at the finale , which is too touchy-feely and sweet , almost negating what came before it .  rat race is a summer sleeper , but it will keep you awake , as will the laughter of those watching around you .  
1 tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever .  not surprising , considering its tiny us$100 , 000 budget , to date it has earned in excess of us$130 million .  that's a shocking 100 times profit !  rumours have it that a smart internet `marketing' ploy was so successful in gaining cult-like fanatics , by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews , the film just exploded in the box-office , raking in millions on its opening weekend .  shot in 16mm and video ( i suspect . ) , the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch .  audiences are put in the first-person perspective in the entire mis-adventure , often wobbly and blurry at times , it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning .  this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared ; edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences .  tbwp is simply smart .  filmed to look as if it was really a stock-shoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project , one may suspect ( like yours truly ) that its simply a lazy but smart approach to film-making .  simply amazing in that respect , i must say .  talk about impact , oh yes , tbwp does have quite a bit , in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing .  i did , especially the last bit but i'm not revealing more .  you have to see it for yourself .  i can't help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become .  could it be that finally , an indie-film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal ?  or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning ?  well , i guess the fact stays ; tbwp is highly original , clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film .  no gore , no special effects , i just can't get over how terribly smart this film is !  
1 meet joe black ( reviewed on nov . 27/98 )  starring brad pitt , anthony hopkins , claire forlani  in " meet joe black " , brad pitt plays death .  that's all that really needs to be said , but nevertheless , i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description .  death decides to take a holiday , what with all the rigors of soul-collecting and all , and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it's like to be human .  death assumes the body of brad pitt , and from there , much trouble ensues .  for one thing , death-as-pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter , played by claire forlani .  obviously this enrages hopkins , because really , what can death offer ?  besides eternal damnation , of course .  there is also a sub-plot about forlani's ex-boyfriend ( she dumps him for pitt ) trying to take over hopkins company .   " meet joe black " runs just under three hours .  i've always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics .   " meet joe black " is neither historical nor is it an epic , though i get the feeling martin brest ( the director ) desperately wants it to be .  every single scene in the movie goes on about 3-4 minutes too long .  and the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should .  a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent , instead of just good , which is what it is .  pitt , an actor i normally loathe , is actually quite engaging as death .  i believed his performance , and i could see why forlani's character would fall in love with him .  i have to agree with roger ebert , though , who found it hard to believe that an entity that's been around for all time wouldn't know what peanut butter was .  that has nothing to do with pitt's performance , of course , but it is a little distracting .  hopkins gives his usual excellent performance .  he's able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left , without making him an obnoxious whiner .  and in her first major studio role , claire forlani is surprisingly good .  she has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her .  so , " meet joe black " is a good movie hampered by it's ridiculous running time .  had the film been cut by an hour or so , i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review .  
1 capsule : trippy , hyperspeed action machine from hong kong's accomplished tsui hark .  van damme and rodman have nice chemistry , the stunts are eyepopping , and stuff gets blowed up real good ; what more do you want ?  i admit i was all set to loathe double team ; it reeked of cheapjack timing-oriented marketing ( stick dennis rodman in a movie , quick , while he's hot , and do something about jean-claude van damme's flagging career while we're at it ! ) .  surprise -- double team transcends its dumb roots and turns out to be a mess of fun .  bring some friends , get some pretzels , and have a blast .  van damme is jack quinn , an ex-agent who is brought back in for " one last mission " -- you'd think any spy worth his shoe phone would run like hell when he hears those words .  but van damme's character has a pregnant wife who's also a sculptor , and some unpleasant pressure gets used to get him to come through on this mission .  he's been assigned to take down an old enemy , a terrorist named stavros ( mickey rourke , looking oddly subdued ) , who may be back up to his old tricks .  in the first showdown between quinn and stavros , the movie wears its ambitions proudly on its sleeve : nonstop action .  an amusement park , a hospital , a private " retired spy " 's retreat , most of rome , various houses , planes , cars and other modes of transport , and the coliseum ( ! )  all become arenas for some of the most bone-rattling shoot-outs and punch-outs filmed .  they are better seen than described and are reason enough to see the film : one jaw-dropping scene has van damme taking on a man who uses a switchblade with his * feet * .   ( van damme is a good , dextrous athlete and fighter , but he is often upstaged . )  there are other nice touches .  stavros and quinn both want the same thing : to retire in peace with their families .  that ambition ties them together in various ways , and also humanizes them a bit .  one of the things about hk action movies is that there's always some form of human element , and that's carried over into this movie as well .  it gives weight to scenes that would otherwise be forgettable .  also good is dennis rodman , playing a weapons dealer named yaz -- a character who sticks out like a fistful of broken fingers and who is funny just standing there .  rodman is natural on screen ; he's fun to watch , especially when slinging bad guys like basketballs , and deserves to get a movie of his own , based on what's seen here : a lightweight , fast-moving entertainment that showcases all of its pieces excellently .  
1 it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival's palme d'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction .  since then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn .  in between , he has moonlighted as an " actor " with several decidedly unmemorable performances .  now , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown .  and , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard's novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed .  for the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie .  the story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses .  and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , '70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens' bare feet .  yet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown .  the sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent .  the mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn't match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino's previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives .  and there aren't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around .  there's a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that's about it .  jackie brown's lone " innovation " is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives .  this isn't exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa's rashomon and most recently in edward zwick's courage under fire .  however , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino's sole purpose for using it appears to be because it's unconventional .  had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost .  as a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity .  for the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a '70s icon .  this time around , instead of john travolta , it's blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) .  in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier's career , tarantino uses a '70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits .  there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) .  grier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states .  she's working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official .  no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv's " banyon " ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal .  jackie passes ordell's test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell's money into the united states without tipping off the feds .  soon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell's perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) .  unsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn't nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction .  in addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) .  robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles .  bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino's foot fetish .  robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor .  the film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) .  tarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself .  when it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort .  it's an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender .  
0 play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways .  like most of shelton's other great films ( bull durham , white men can't jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots .  shelton's films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story .  shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions .  play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse .  the film has no social message like its predecessors .  the relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons .  the whole film , since it is primarily a " buddy picture , " depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other .  unfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below .  1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet .  the two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory .  2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas .  there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something .  3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way .  she is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other .  4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories .  vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner .  these boring tales only hurt the central plot .  5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don't even hesitate to pound each other .  wasn't the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ?  by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over .  shelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story .  forty five painful minutes remain .  the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies .  however , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film .  
0 wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you .  you can see its plot developing from a mile away . you  are lured into its benign story of a single 29-year-old girl looking for a soul mate in boston , as that city is depicted as a mini-wonderland for singles .  this is a star oriented film , and the star who carries the film is erin ( hope davis ) .  that this is a dating film , about singles who for reasons of fate or luck , or whatnot , have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers , is nothing new , this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films .  the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film . the  main quirk in the plot here , is that hope's pushy mother ( hollan ) visits her in boston , sees her daughter's live-in relationship with a radical protester ( hoffman ) breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her harvard medical school drop-out daughter , who works as a nurse .  this is done without her knowledge .  it is cornball sitcom stuff , but , at least , it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director .  it is easy to like erin , she is bright , caring , and attractively blonde .  it is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with , the financially strapped , ruggedly handsome , intelligent 35-year-old alan ( alan ) , who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist .  of course , he comes across as being so good ( though , he does kill some fish in the aquarium ) , that it is hard to believe he's for real , or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for .  the contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as , the subway , at a restaurant , or on the phone .  alan's brother answers erin's ad with a few of his pals , as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way , making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her , that the others witness , will win the bet .  this sub-plot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told .  that we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are , each one more annoying than the other , culminating in the most obnoxious one of all , that brazilian lover ( jose ) , who is about as charming as a snake-oil salesman , who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil , was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story .  anyway , as expected , all's well that ends well , for this watchable piece of fluff , that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story-line .  the dialogue was actually not bad , those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation .  and , oh , by the way , wonderland refers to the stop on the boston metro , it is where greyhound racing takes place .  
1  " the end of the affair " is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs .  although it's slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience .  based on graham greene's novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters .  there's maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile's ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore ) .  sarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he's just a normal guy .  it's all work and no play with him .  while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her .  unfortunately the two break up .  this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present .  it's a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too .  while this may sound straight forward it's not .  it's a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men , unhappiness , and the ever lasting love .  all this may sound like a drag , but it really captures your interest .  with great performances by ralph fiennes ( doing another english patient type of film , only this movie is better ) and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 , i believe this was the role , she had the most passion for , and you can see why .  the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan .  even though i didn't read the book , there's no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive .  what's so moving about it you ask ?  the tragedy of it all .  it's not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing .  it really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect .  everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces .  back to neil jordan's script , it wasn't only red roses .  there were times when i felt it too be a little slow , but most romances are .  it also tended to be a bit confusing , especially at the start .  it keep jumping around from past to present , so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things .  also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan .  i'd have to say this is his finest achievement to date , because quite frankly i've never really found his work to be up to par .  it just never did anything for me , until now .  when it ends , it leaves viewers a little saddened , but provoked nonetheless .  this is definitely one of the best films of 99 , and had some of the best acting , most notably by moore .  not for all movie goers , but for those who are film buffs and want something of value .  
0  " desperate measures " is a generic title for a film that's beyond generic .  it's also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more " before and after " than " reversal of fortune . "  the movie is a big disappointment , and yet it's somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing .  too bad the execution's all wrong , though , because the set-up of " desperate measures " boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use .  san francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission .  even worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society .  connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he's at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital .  when he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy .  one misstep " desperate measures " makes is in its underdevelopment of matt's illness .  what's needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow .  take , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital .  the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ?  he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight .  connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son .  whatever .  to be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie's problems .  first and foremost is how cheaply " desperate measures " trades the potential of it's opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour .  once mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills .  there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away .  also , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia's frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; " desperate measures " appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie's head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this .  there is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department .  cast against type , michael keaton's understated menace is highly effective .  although he's not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord .  joseph cross , as garicia's ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos .  this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but most is lost .  it goes without saying that " desperate measures " needs an operation of its very own .  
0 if you've been following william fichtner's career ( and there's absolutely no reason why you should have ) , you might have noticed that he's played some rather similar roles over the years .  like sully in " the perfect storm " --tough , gruff , and a little bit scary .  or law in " albino alligator " --tough , gruff , and little bit scarier .  or colonel william sharp in " armageddon , " or dwayne engelman in " strange days , " or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of " pearl harbor , " as the abusive father of danny--here is an actor who gravitates towards tough , gruff , hard-hitting roles .  which is why his performance in " what's the worst that could happen ? "  is such a shock , such a delight .  in the film , fichtner plays a blonde haired , meticulously dressed , overtly effeminate , dog-loving detective .  as alex tardio , fichtner's performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it .  it borders on offensive but doesn't really manage it .  and it borders on clich ? d stereotype but doesn't quite succumb to that definition either .  in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming , fichtner isn't perfect--you can see him struggling a little at times , concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air , or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personal--but he's pretty damned good , and silly , and without question the best thing in the film .  in fact , had it not been for fitchner's sudden and bizarre appearance , and his jarring screen presence thereafter , i would have walked out , for " what's the worst that could happen ? "  is mesmerizing in its awfulness , a poorly written , haphazardly edited , and totally unfunny ( yes , it stars martin lawrence and danny devito so how could that be possible ? )  moviegoing experience .  fichtner's performance doesn't exactly save the film , and it's not like i'm recommending " what's the worst that could happen ? "  solely on the strength of the actor's dramatic turnaround , but his contributions do raise the film's rating from no stars to one-and-a-half .  thumbs up to fichtner then , and thumbs down--way , way , down--to everyone else involved in this sorry mess , a movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesn't even warrant discussion .  
1 susan granger's review of " legally blonde " ( m . g . m . )  it's a " pretty in pink " / " clueless " coming-of-age story for the new millennium as elle woods ( reese witherspoon ) , a perky southern california sorority queen , switches from fashion to law in order to win back her yuppy boyfriend ( matthew davis ) .  the girl-power story begins as this sweetheart of delta nu is unceremoniously dumped by a bonehead who says : " if i'm going to be a senator by the time i'm 30 . . . i  need to marry a jackie , not a marilyn . "  determined to prove she's as smart a snobby brunette ( selma blair ) from country-club connecticut , elle not only applies to harvard law school but gets in , much to the amazement of family , friends and faculty .  once there , this flaxen-haired fish-out-of-water not only survives but tenaciously thrives , befriending a local manicurist ( jennifer coolidge ) , dazzling a professor ( victor garber ) and rescuing a defendant ( ali larter ) in a celebrated boston murder trial , plus finding a more worthy beau ( luke wilson ) .  in the tradition of teen-comedy film-maker john hughes and his disciple amy heckerling , there's wit , cheerfulness , a fidelity of observation and a penchant for problem-solving .  first-time feature director robert luketic is blessed with reese witherspoon who's joyously incandescent in this utterly formulaic light comedy written by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith , based on a soon-to-be-published novel by amanda brown .  the supporting cast is terrific , particularly raquel welch and holland taylor - and i particularly got a kick out of the gag of elle distributing scented resumes in pink , her signature color on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " legally blonde " is a frivolous , funny , feel-good 8 .  filled with ditzy blonde ambition , it's a movie for high-school kids that their parents would be happy to have them see .  
0 fantastically over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen .  the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands , then an attack on a boat from some beast , and finally we join dr . nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking about 17 years old ) doing some research in chernobyl .  some shady u . s government guys appear , and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints , from what looks like a giant lizard .  and what's more , this beast is heading for new york .  gulp !  although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride , and at some points it is , there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie .  the main faults lie with the acting and writing , common problems with 'summer blockbuster' movies .  broderick is pretty useless as the hero , with no humour or a 'tough guy' image .  while emmerich's previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith , this has neither .  also , maria pitillo , as broderick's former girlfriend , is just as useless , with a chronic disability in acting .  she's incapable of showing emotion , speaks every line in the same way , and basically she's total crap .  it's up to french actor jean reno to save the day , and indeed he does , turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent .  shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film .  hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named 'animal' , and he adds a little life to the picture .  also making an appearance is harry shearer ( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons ) as a slimy news reporter .  o . k , so the acting is not up to par , but it never is in these movies .  but what about the script ?  well , that's not up to par either .  emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script .  the dialogue is banal ( broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters 'that's a lot of fish . ' ) , and the character development is non existent ( reno plays the typical frenchman ( 'no croissant ? ' ) ,  broderick forever remains a geeky scientist . )  also , the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour .  the jokes that are uttered are pathetic , and there's an 'hilarious' running gag about siskel and ebert .   ( the mayor is mayor ebert , and is assistant is called gene !  ha ha ha ha ! . )  the plot is dire , and in the end just rips off jurassic park ( 1993 ) by having lots of baby godzilla's ( i . e .  velicorapters ) running around new york .  right , so the script and acting suck .  but what about the special effects ?  thankfully , they're are quite good .  godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi , although we don't see much of him because the movie is so dark .  the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell .  but although they are impressive , they can't save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie .  the movie goes on for far too long aswell , and it can't seem to decide on a ending .  and of course , the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel .  let's just hope one never arrives .  
1 did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet ?  or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra-terrestrial ?  i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher , ms . carey .  but after seeing this movie , they may have confirmed my suspicions .  as the story goes , at any time , there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth .  the men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens , guardians of our beloved planet from nasty-tempered aliens , and secret service to the stars .  based in new york city ( where weird is the norm ) , the mib organization gives human form to our space-faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed .  but to enforce the laws of earth , the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast .  they carry other-worldly technology to erase people's short-term memory when common folk see the mib in action .  and their best leads on cosmic things-gone-awry are the supermarket tabloids .  little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v . evil going on in the depths of space .  one of the aliens-as-human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious .  it holds the 'key' , literally , to universal peace .  a giant cockroach-like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this 'key' .  in the wrong alien hands ( flippers ?  mandibles ?  tentacles ? ) , it can be used as a weapon .  therefore , it must be recovered and returned to it's rightful owners .  otherwise , to ensure universal safety , earth will be destroyed , along with the 'key' .  now , it's the mib who must prevent this catastrophe .  the mib agents on the case are " k " , played by tommy lee jones .  he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore .  the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes .  he is accompanied by a flippant rookie , " j " , played by will smith .  but , despite this shoot-em-up , protect-earth-from-destruction premise , this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie .  and , this isn't an independence day knockoff .  rather , this is a stylishly offbeat sci-fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies ? that there are real aliens that live here , and that the government does its darndest to cover them up .  but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe , there must be some kind of earth-hangs-in-the-balance scenario .  yet , this movie is very appealing .  the abundance of wierdness ( talking aliens , pee-wee atomizers , a mortician who 'lives' for her work , and lots of yucky bugs and slime-splattering galore ) , is played straight , like as if this were normal ( of course , we are in nyc ) .  it gives it a deadpan feel , which makes it all the more funnier and odder .  jones plays the venerable seen-it-all agent with seriousness and maturity .  smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones' straight man routine .  they click like dorothy's ruby red shoes .  the look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld ( the addam's family ) .  this guy has a knack for 'gothic' comedy , and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen .  and , an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors .  the story moves well , and before you know it , the end credits are already rolling !  the result is 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs , aaaahhhs and wows .  let the men in black protect and color your world .  
1 in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer .  the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u . s . , and even developed a cult following , much like the previous year's 100 million dollar grossing scream .  when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend , it looked like a wonderful follow-up .  did it live up to the first film ?  the answer is no .  jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james , a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before .  she has been so upset since the incident .  nightmares haunt her all over the place , but she has to move on .  she know attends college , and is best friends with a funny , outgoing girl named karla ( brandy ) , who is trying to hook julie up with will benson , played by newcomer matthew settle .  karla's boyfriend is tyrell , the funny , outgoing type , who is played by soul food's mekhi phifer .  freddie prinze jr . also returns as ray , julie's boyfriend from a year ago .  one morning , julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil .  of course , they answer it correctly , and they are off to the bahamas .  julie wants ray to come , but he declines the offer , so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie .  after they arrive at their hotel , it is just them and the staff on the island .  it starts off as the weekend of their dreams .  something just had to come to mess up the one care-free weekend of julie's life though .  ben willis ( muse watson ) is back , and he isn't letting anyone survive this time .  will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one ?  jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances .  brandy in particular was impressive , considering this is her first feature film .  you could see that the characters were horrified , and they would do anything possible to survive .  matthew settle and freddie prinze jr . are a completely different story .  let's start with settle .  matthew is completely fake in this film .  you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth .  you could tell he was acting , and its reasons like him that this one isn't as good as the first one .  he does do a good job towards the end , but that doesn't clear up the scars he already left on the film .  freddie prinze jr . is almost as bad as matthew settle was .  he is almost completely unbelievable , and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place .  we don't see him as much as settle , otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did .  mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell , but yet again the dialogue is out of place .  the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie .  i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment , but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one , it would have been a bit better .  the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful .  there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel .  the sound is pretty good , but still not as creepy as the first film's .  jennifer love hewitt's song , " how do i deal " is also played for about thirty seconds .  i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film .  the first film was very suspenseful , and it contained some very memorable scenes .  the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up , and almost reached the same level as the first film .  before this part in the film , there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares .  that is okay though , because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes .  i think the reason this film wasn't as scary as the original was because in the first one , the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident .  he made them suffer for what they did .  in the second film , ben willis just kills anyone he feels like .  he doesn't stick with ray and julie , who were the ones he is actually after .  he had to go after karla , will , and tyrell .  if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie , ray , helen , and barry , it could have been much better , and it would have made a lot more sense .  the bottom line- not a disappointment , but a third in the series would be out of hand .  
0 not so long ago , men by the names of peckinpah , ford , leone , and eastwood made westerns .  real westerns .  these were some of the best films of the twentieth century .  those days are gone .  now we have crap like wild wild west to pass for the western .  and that record is not improved with the unbearable tale of american outlaws .  outlaws is yet another re-telling of the jesse james legend , courtesy of b-movie king james g . robinson ( producer of such classics as wrongfully accused and chill factor ) .  delayed since the spring , this version stars the irish hunka hunka burning love colin farrell ( the best part of schumacher's tigerland ) as the bad-ass jesse james .  alas , any sense of his character has been left on the ranch , leaving us with only cute chicks like ali larter ( minus the whipped cream ) to watch .  the spin this time around : fresh from serving as southern militiamen in the civil war , jesse james ( farrell ) , his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , and his pal cole younger ( scott caan ) lay down their arms and head home to missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended .  but trouble is brewing in their small town of liberty when evil railroad baron thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) and his cronies rollin parker ( terry o'quinn ) and allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) demand the boys turn over their lands to the railroads .  the jameses and the youngers then join forces to fight the railroad -- by robbing banks up and down missouri , thus cutting off the railroad's financial surplus and playing robin hood to the local people .  along the way , the boys squabble over who's the cutest of the gang , who's the most popular cowboy in the gang , and who ought to go on mtv's total request live .  they rob numerous banks with identical interiors , always with the kindest of hearts , strutting in their grungy dusters as moby songs play in the background .  the witty banter they share could be plastered within a hallmark card .  the biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of colin farrell .  after a great job in tigerland , farrell walks through this role easier then nicolas cage in gone in 60 seconds .  and his american accent rivals richard gere's irish accent in the jackal .  combined with feeling like bonanza : the teen years , this homogenized production ( toned down to get the ever-popular pg-13 rating ) gives us an invincible jesse james that quickly grows tiresome and boring .  the unbearable villains courtesy of timothy dalton and thaddeus rains spend the entire film proclaiming that everyone should be hanged , sucking out any energy left in the film .  not to mention : the real story of jesse james and his gang bears no resemblance to the plot of american outlaws .  instead , the movie is full of old , outrageous tales about the wild west -- tales which went out of style in 5-cent magazines about a century ago .  
1 mickey mouse had better watch his back -- there's a new critter in town , and he's the nameless animal attraction of " mouse hunt , " dreamworks skg's clever first foray into family fare .  although it runs out of steam towards its end , this live-action comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disney's entire 1997 non-animated , kiddie-oriented catalog . . .  but consider that list includes dismal tripe like " air bud , " " flubber " and " that darn cat , " and it's really not such a difficult feat to pull off .  still , throw the two rodents in a boxing arena , and i'll be hoping that the mouse from " mouse hunt " knocks some sense back into mickey .  nathan lane ( robin williams' significant other from " the birdcage " ) and lee evans ( last seen as a nervous bellhop in " the fifth element " ) play ernie and lars smuntz , befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father ( william hickey , in his last role ) -- a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old mansion .  although lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former , he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect .  but there's a lone obstacle in their way -- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house , and he's not about to give up his place of residence without a fight .  movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite .  the effects blending the talents of 60-some live mice , one animatronic mouse and one computer-generated mouse are pretty seamless .  the splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burton's mind ; the smuntz's architecturally-unsound mansion is like something straight out of " the nightmare before christmas , " and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent price's warped contraptions from " edward scissorhands . "   " mouse hunt " is a pretty dark movie -- even some of the humor can be grim -- but it's hardly ever mean-spirited .  the star of the show is neither the top-billed lane nor the titular mouse .  it's lanky british comedian evans , whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned-up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill ( note a toned-down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease ) ; evans' banter with the ever-affable lane is funny stuff , too , and holds its own against the movie's more flashy physical shtick .  vicki lewis ( beth from " newsradio " ) is solid in a supporting role as lars' money-grubbing wife .  and in a nifty bit of novelty casting , christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously , popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a " calcium deficiency . "  blech .  a basically one-joke idea -- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans -- is given a rather engaging execution .  their sparring is imaginatively realized ( i don't think i'll ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda ) , and although you really never fully root for either side , that's okay -- a warm-and-fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share .   " mouse hunt " may take a while to get going ( the rather lengthy set-up could test the patience of some of the younger children , although i rather liked it , much in part to lane and evans ) , and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long , but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable , not unlike the original " home alone . "  
0 it was with a huge lack of something to do that i decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon , when the only good things on tv are the second-rate movies they show ( some are good : they showed " total recall " before this one ) .  if you know me , i think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live .  and this includes keanu reeves .  what do i hate about seagal ?  i hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and non-threatening situation ( the squint ) .  i hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around , bullying people up , saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynold's hairpiece in " boogie nights . "  i despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights .  i hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain .  i hate his non-satirical messages ( in the beginning of this one , he slaps on a quote from arthur miller , which has nothing to do with the film , except it's about brooklyn where this film takes place ) .  and i hate how he's so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing ( during the end credits , he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him ) .  sure , the guy's probably a nice guy in person ( i actually found him very non-threatening when he was on letterman not too long ago ) .  but the guy makes worse films than reagan did .  so what's the plot of this shit-terpiece ?  well . . . something  about him trying to catch a stupid-ass crook ( william forsythe ) who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight .  i couldn't believe how bad this scene was - the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ( ahem ! ) .  and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off .  i'm sorry , did anyone ever hear of concealing one's self ?  so in comes ex-brooklynite seagal , who dedicates his life to catching this guy .  and i just wished he had caught him in the beginning , then ended the film .  but noooo , this drags on , as he bullies forsythe's family members ( including a stupid bar-owner , and none other than gina gershon as his other bar-owner sister ) .  and forsythe more than once threatens his family .  at one point , he actually comes to their house and stalks them like a non-threatening nicholson in " the shining " ( complete with them all hiding in the bathroom , but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away ) .  seagal paints himself as a lovable person , with a son , and a fiancee .  he even shows him hanging with his son , checking up on his homework , and then about to take him out for a bit of " catch , " when he's conveniently called away on assignment .  i dunno about you , but playing " catch " with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares .  he also shows him as that bad-ass he wants to be , with scenes of him bullying crooks around , and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after he's unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue .  serves them right .  this film , as some of his do , has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented , but don't appear to be in this film .  i already mentioned gina gershon ( who's pretty horrible in this one ) , as well as william forsythe , who over-acts terribly .  i know this guy can act : he was awesome in " raising arizona " as goodman's partner in crime .  but he's just awful here .  jerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down .  why is he the only one who gives a good performance ?  well , because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility .  he seems to be in here just to give it a cool " law and order " feeling ( even if it's not a " cool " feeling ) .  and in cameos are b-rated erotic-thriller-cinemax-style stars , shannon whirry ( as " terry malloy , " which is more of a bad joke than a clever one ) and athena massey .  oh !  and " er " 's julliana margiulles has two scenes .   " out for justice " just proves once again that american action films just suck .  i know that there's such a good thing as good action - he's called john woo .  but if you're in the mood for some good old no-brainer , fun-yet-dumb action , don't bother watching this .  it's so stupid that it's boring .  
0 funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways .  the ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature .  what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters .   " get new jobs ! "  was one line , if i remember correctly .  at the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda .  he is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off .  patterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) .  the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy .  they are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature .  give me a break .  the movie hasn't got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it's just trying to find convenient ways to stall us .  even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic .  get this : remington's big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up .  he does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird .  by the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand .  the acting is forgettable .  douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it's nothing he hasn't done before .  kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography .  the camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent .  what did i expect from this movie ?  i dunno .  some real excitement , i suppose .  a sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation .  no such luck .  i dug out my tattered copy of hemingway's " the short happy life of francis macomber " and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind .  
0 studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it's a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn't be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film .  are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ?   " 54 " belongs in the elite group of films known as " the big disappointments " : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished .  i was heavily awaiting " 54 , " not the least because i've become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that's been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this " edgy " film .  perhaps more importantly , " 54 " is part of the blossoming subgenre , " the 70s nostalgia film , " which has been picking up mighty steam , what with " boogie nights " and " the last days of disco " coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from " boogie nights , " and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from " the last days of disco , " not to mention several others .   " 54 " deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that's all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it .  this is a definite plus .  here's a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening .  the story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let's look at how it all affected the people .  but this film doesn't let that happen .  it gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , from " i know what you did last summer " ) , who's chief character trait is the fact that he's from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) .  he's dim-witted , into being part of " the scene , " and soon finds he's become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a  bit like " saturday night fever , " 'cept no travolta and no real interest put into him .  poor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been .  shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from " clueless " ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame .  although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that's all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film .  the film's sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) .  rubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that .  notice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who've only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails .  first time feature director mark christopher proves that he's a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much .  his story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject .  it's as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route .  the studio's recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough .  some people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film's tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini's " la dolce vita " ) , and when i watched " 54 , " i didn't particularly want to stay .  
0 i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick .  take the professional , for example .  it boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions .  it's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension .  the professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant .  the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated .  one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door .  her name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a .  agent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda's father tried to rip him off .  leon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother .  the two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both .  writer/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin .  there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting .  but beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe .  the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop .  leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies .  jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda .  natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either .  besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing .  a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag .  gary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch .  there isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more .  a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way .  there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely .  but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing .  this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty .  a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact .  
0 the first film produced by adam sandler's happy madison production company ( clever title eh ? ) is essentially a one joke movie , much like the movies sandler stars in himself .  however the difference here is that this one joke just isn't very funny .  rob schneider stars as the title character , a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a " man-whore " to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client's custom made fish tank , which deuce destroyed while staying in his home .  deuce goes on numerous " dates " , and each woman he goes out with has a " humorous " quirk about herself .  one has narcolepsy , one has tourette's syndrome , one is a man . . .  etc . etc .  my problem is that we see all of these women in the film's trailer , so why do i need to watch the movie ?  seen the trailer . . .  seen the film .  only a quick cameo from norm macdonald ( and a follow up joke during the closing credits ) generates any chuckles .  deuce bigalow : male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video ( a division of di$ney ) .  the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , and features the original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for mystery alaska , happy texas , and outside providence ) , an extremely brief production featurette ( which contains footage not used in the film ) , and storyboard-to-scene comparisons .  yep , you read that right . . .  there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd .  two scenes are storyboarded . . .  neither of which are particularly exciting .  there are fight scenes in this movie , so why aren't we seeing storyboards of those segments ( especially the parody moments from the matrix ) ?  i wonder what's funnier : the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that di$ney thought fans of this film would want to see them ?  deleted scenes ?  sure .  audio commentary ?  you betcha .  but storyboards ?  come on .

0 tomb raider .  fun ?  exciting ?  challenging ?  given the unprecedented popularity ( especially among teenage boys ) of the video game that sports an uber-buff , pistol packin' babe who raids , well . . .  tombs , you have to believe it's these three things and more !   " lara croft : tomb raider , " the big screen variant of said video game , which features a pumped-up angelina jolie ( the oscar ? winner for " girl , interrupted " no less ) in the title role is , however , none of these things .  it isn't fun , it isn't exciting , and the only challenge is seeing how long you can stay in your seat ( i suffered through to the bitter , bitter end ; the wife opted for barnes & noble at the 45-minute mark ) .  directed by simon west with the same subtlety he brought to " con air , " " tomb raider " is an empty-headed , big budget bore .  the story borrows unintelligently from that mother of all turkeys " hudson hawk " ( the same hokum about planetary alignments and sacred stones that , when brought together , well . . .  who the heck cares ? ) and it makes " super mario bros . " ( bob hoskins' ill-advised career move ) look like " rocco and his brothers " ( that classic of italian neo-realism ) .  i'll go out on a limb here and say i suspect there's actually more character development in the video game than the movie proper .  this is where the jolie defenders/video game nuts jump in and say this movie isn't about character development it's about kicking serious butt ( or bum , since ms . croft hails from england's green and pleasant ) .  with lips , breasts , and biceps all inflated to the max , lara croft is all about posturing , and jolie has a hard time simply standing still without trying to look tough .  ok , let's forget challenging .  shouldn't " tomb raider " be , at the very least , fun and exciting ?  shouldn't our butt-kicking heroine also encompass the sophistication of , say , james bond with the wit of indiana jones ?  there's no humor to be found anywhere in " tomb raider , " even though it tries hard from time to time .  even " the mummy returns " didn't take itself too seriously .  the villain here is noticeably lacking , the special effects are ridiculously overblown and unnecessarily complicated , and the script is non-existent .  to liven things up ( perhaps ) , jolie's live father jon voight puts in a few minutes as lara's dead father lord croft ; talk about a stretch .  one thing i hadn't expected from the film is that jolie affects a slightly better english accent than her pa ( although i suspect that thin-looking moustache he's forced to wear gets in the way some ) .  unsuccessful ? not entirely .  if anything , " lara croft : tomb raider " makes you want to check out the video game itself to figure out exactly what all the fuss was about .  
0 two party guys bob their heads to haddaway's dance hit " what is love ? "  while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub .  it's barely enough to sustain a three-minute _saturday_night_live_ skit , but _snl_ producer lorne michaels , _clueless_ creator amy heckerling , and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution's recurring " roxbury guys " sketch that would presumably make a good feature .  emphasis on the word " presumably . "  _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point--and that of viewers' patience levels .  the first five minutes or so of _roxbury_ play very much like one of the original " roxbury guys " skits .  with " what is love ? "  blaring on the soundtrack , the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrell ) bob their heads , scope out " hotties " at clubs , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts .  there is one crucial difference , however--these guys speak .  that little fact has been used as justification for the film's existence , that the butabis' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters .  the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren , ferrell , and kattan are new , that's for sure , but they all lead to comic dead ends .  there is no story per se , only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots .  the brothers literally run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame , and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club .  there , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicuously uncredited--can you blame him ? ) , who takes an interest in an idea of theirs .  meanwhile , the bros' overbearing father ( dan hedaya ) wants them to stop clubbing .  when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father , a rift is created between the two .  the narrative messiness of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny , but virtually none of it is .  the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film , with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end .  alas , the joke--a rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire_--will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film .  granted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film's best joke is completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_'s lack of inspiration .  that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves .  like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , " the roxbury guys " is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context .  after watching one of the " roxbury " skits on snl , this is what you come away with from the characters : they bob their heads to " what is love ? " ,  bump unsuspecting women , and . . . that's all .  after watching _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ , you'll be left with exactly the same .  
1 my summer was recently saved by two very different movies .  on opening night , i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron .  then a few nights later , i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman's greenfingers even though it didn't feature a trip to band camp , girl-on-girl action , or seann william scott .  however , i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers , which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs ( clive owen of croupier ) .  after spending roughly half of his life behind bars , he is transferred to a more lenient facility , edgefield .  the picaresque , rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade , while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges .  at first , briggs doesn't want to be there .  he's used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone .  however , his ailing roommate , fergus ( david kelly of waking ned devine ) , wears briggs down through his benign nature .  the two become friends , with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift .  briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil , and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers .  after the prison's governor ( warren clarke ) reprimands them , he's awed at what briggs has accomplished .  and he's struck by an idea -- briggs , fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prison's grounds .  greenfingers , which is " inspired by actual events , " becomes a bit like a sports movie after that .  despite their differences , the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game -- in this case a prestigious garden show .  one renegade , in this case , briggs , will prove to have talent .  of course , love will also rear its head ( no , not " prison love " ) .  to hershman's credit , he doesn't pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs , like last year's lame marijuana comedy saving grace .  i had to keep pinching myself when i didn't see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies , or the men giving high-fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers .  the movie deals with people and scores on that concept .  it's wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again .  give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting .  his speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freeman's last stand in the shawshank redemption .  owen's bedside scenes with kelly , who lends the film a human touch , are a marvel to behold , emotionally gripping without being sappy .  written by hershman , greenfingers contains plenty of laughs .  most come courtesy of helen mirren , who shines as the world-class gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose ( natasha little ) when she starts dating briggs .  the mother can't believe what he'll do if her daughter " burns the sunday roast . "  nothing is forced in greenfingers .  the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines .  primrose and briggs' relationship takes awkward steps .  even when briggs decides to go back to edgefield , it's done for reasons of loyalty , not because the movie requires him to do so .  after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like america's sweethearts and the princess dairies , it's an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well .  
0  " spice world " is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls .  sure there's a hint of humor in there every once in a while .  actually , there's a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls .  but overall , who cares ?  not me .  if you don't know by now , the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power , yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood .  in " spice world " they ride around in their big tour bus , whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews .  amazingly , all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things , things they want to do , not things they are required to do to keep earning money .  and they keep babbling about " girl power " when they should really be talking about " cleavage power " .  i mean , if all it takes is girl power , then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits ?  the film is pg , but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions , you'd have yourself one raunchy adult film .  by the way , there's something in the opening credits which says " based on an idea by the spice girls " .  wow , they got idea credit !  i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood . . .  giving credit for simply having the thought " say girls , let's make a movie ! "  the supporting cast fares well .  roger moore ( the real james bond ) mockingly plays the cliche-spewing " chief " of the spice girls , and darn it all , he's fun to watch .  mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band's manager ( richard e . grant ) .  one question though : george wendt ?  you'd think that " spice world " would envoke one of two reactions in people .  if you like the spice girls , you'll like them even more afterwards .  and if you can't stand them ( like me ) , then " spice world " will really make you sick .  oddly , the audience i saw the film with , roughly 50 twelve year-old girls , sat in silence for the entire film .  well , not the two who sat directly behind me .  they kept muttering " this is stupid " over and over again .  maybe there is hope for humanity after all .

1 plot : a big-time momma's boy can't seem to leave his mother's crib and make good on the babies that he himself has produced in the world .  he visits his kids ( and their mommas ) every now and then , but his main goal in life is . . . well , he doesn't have any goals .  then one day , his mother gets an ex-gangsta boyfriend and suddenly he isn't as welcome anymore in his own house .  it isn't long after that , that his girlfriends start realizing what a jerk he really is and well . . . it's  either time to grow up or bow down !  critique : first things first !  this movie ain't about the " hood " at all , it's an intelligent film about love , relationships , family , friendship , maturity and growing up .  do not avoid this film because you think it's about gangbangers and stuff , because it isn't at all .  it's about you , it's about me , it's about your girlfriend , your mother , your problems and your inability to face up to your responsibilities and to , well . . . grow  up !  this is an extremely well-written film , with some of the most developed characters that i've seen on the screen all year , with superb acting performances to match .  granted , the film does start a little slow ( and go a little long ) , but hang in there , because once you appreciate and get to know all of its characters , you will be glad that you did .  this isn't a kid's movie .  this is about the step that you need to take in order to pass into full " adulthood " and some might not appreciate the grander theme behind that step .  i certainly did , because i too passed , and am passing , through many of these very same things right now ( yeah , yeah , i still live with my momma ! ! ) and related to a lot of the events that went down in this flick ( oh yeah , and for the record , i'm not black but that made absolutely zero difference in this case ) .  but that's not even half the story .  you see , the film is damn funny , too . . . and  i mean , damn funny !  i was crackin' up at almost every other scene , and they weren't " set-up jokes " like your typical comedies either , just day-to-day things that we could all relate to ( like the scene in which ving rhames is " drinking koolaid " in the kitchen and his infamously improvised " african squat f * * k " scene , which you just gotta see to believe ! )  and there are the performances , too .  ving rhames , now here's a man who has already established an early lead in the race for best supporting actor at the end of this year .  damn dude , you scared the shit outta me !  tyrese gibson , i have no idea where this guy came from ( an r&b singer and mtv vj , you say . . . hmmmm ? ) , but other than his uncanny resemblance to taye diggs , he nailed this part to the tee .  from scene one on , i was glued to his performance and sympathized with his character as he molded and shaped himself into the person that he hoped to become one day .  and everyone else , too .  gibson's girlfriend in the film , taraji henson , made me a backer with her many subtle touches , all of which helped raise her character several levels above the " typical " bitchie girlfriend that we've seen in many of these relationship movies .  but that's the thing that i liked the most about this movie .  everyone seemed real , the situations felt authentic , the characters all came across as people like you and me with issues and struggles and hopes and fears .  i liked this movie a lot because it was masterfully written , wonderfully acted and genuinely entertaining to watch .  and yeah , i even liked the whole homage to boyz 'n the hood that singleton pulled off in the end ( he called this movie a " companion piece " to that film ) .  a very solid follow-up to an ever greater original , baby boy is a film to be seen by anyone who feels like they never wanna grow up .  note : the guy who plays jody's best friend in this movie is omar gooding , cuba gooding jr . 's younger brother ( cuba starred in 1991's boyz 'n the hood ) .  where's joblo coming from ?  the best man ( 8/10 ) - brothers ( 5/10 ) - shaft ( 7/10 ) - summer of sam ( 7/10 ) - what's cooking ( 7/10 )  
1 when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image .  when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships .  when han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point .  cool .  _october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky .  was it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ?  have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ?  it sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal .  determined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them .  it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket .  when lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win .  but the joy in a film like this is in the little details .  for example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class .  if he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer .  it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does .  it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again .  homer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ .  here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions .  this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is .  he is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams .  but he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how .  through coal-mining .  because of his character , we can see how far we+ve come .  the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us .  we don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family .  the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life .  so _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought .  and this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you .  btw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background .  another commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago .  
0 lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects .  after the familiar 'a long time ago . . . . '  opening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game .  the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade .  however , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park . )  they also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd )  star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters .  the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic .  the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent .  there's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is .  the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn't help .  there's no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod .  the script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother .  there's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it's evident that not much is going to happen .  the two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it .  qui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for .  the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time .  maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy . )  anakin is annoying and unlikeable . ,  instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended .  it's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible .  the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him .  although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny .  the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer , because i knew he wouldn't be able to talk for a while .  queen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must 'serve her people , ' and go goo-goo over anakin .  again , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here .  the actors don't help the movie much either .  liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible .  mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm .  the casting director must have chose him because he's scottish like alec guinness : there's little other explanation for it .  natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance .  and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice .  there's very little talent evident with him , it's hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there .  he's not even very 'cute . '  the main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay .  there's nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well .  the cgi takes away much of the human element , however .  the battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers .  episode 1 is just disappointing .  it's got high production values , but little else .  the music is meandering , except near the end .  the plot gives us no-one to root for , or even care for .  the effects are nice , but dull .  the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should .  there's an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair , and many clich ? s are catered for throughout the film .  apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose , except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film .  disappointing is barely the word .  rating=  
0  " mercury rising " has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary .  that's right .  the major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better .  this central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic .  his name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it .  simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him .  the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of " mercury rising . "  i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon's character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost .  miko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he's touched , and has a hard time looking at other people .  it's a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn't playing like he's autistic .  unlike dustin hoffman's performance in " rain man " or leonardo dicaprio's in " what's eating gilbert grape , " we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting .  however , unlike " rain man " which used its character's autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , " mercury rising " could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid .  hell , he doesn't even have to be shy .  in fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis' arm .  willis' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything .  he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon's house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide .  of course , we know that isn't the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents .  simon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked .  jeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon .  this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon's parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes .  late in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop .  of all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst .  i can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey's character is far too accommodating .  not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent .  the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point .  the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here " mercury rising " doesn't rise to the challenge .  the movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including " sea of love " ( 1989 ) and " malice " ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion .  there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were .  the grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it's more suspenseful that way .  taken as a whole , " mercury rising " is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor .  usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious .  this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts .  maybe the book was better , but the way it's handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore .  
1 go's is a gloriously slick hip machine .  director liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l . a . , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them .  after more than ninety minutes of pill-popping , tantric sex , car chases , and attempted murder , go even has a happy ending .  this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down , i anticipated an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder sermon that ( blessedly ) didn't arrive .  a la tarantino's pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories .  the basics are as follows : ronna ( polley ) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough .  her co-worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas .  zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust .  perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino's non-linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id-fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind-reading cat ! ) ;  pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last .  torontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was " not pleased with " her turn as the ill-fated cashier .  in go , she delivers , hands-down , her best performance to date .  here's an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you .  if she doesn't want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said " no , " not go .  but i digress .  go is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one can't help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride .  in that sense , it's a departure from liman's last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of vince vaughan's trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story's clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald's for their latest commercial ) .  i wish i cared more about go's characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous .  when the lights came up and stung my eyes , it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me .  yet entertain me it did .  go is light and frothy , featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley , timothy olyphant ( scream 2 ) , and especially fichtner , whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs .  fichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers ( in heat , armageddon , and others ) ; his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go .  unlike much of the film , fichtner is unpredictable .  
0 in my opinion , a movie reviewer's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion .  but with soul survivors , i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned .  however , protocol forces me to do otherwise .  soul survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends : cassandra ( melissa sagemiller ) is sweet and innocent .  party girl annabel ( eliza dushku of bring it on ) is dating world-weary harvard student matt ( wes bentley ) .  matt still has feelings for cassie , who is now dating sean ( casey affleck ) .  driving back from a creepy , gothic party , the quartet gets into a horrific car crash .  sean dies , leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty , made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her .  as cassie mopes through her classes , she sees the ghost of sean all over the place , urging her to follow him .  along with being plagued by other ghastly visions , cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party .  annabel and matt try calming her down , but no one shares cass's visions .  she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself .  rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material .  in his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion .  when the movie's camerawork isn't pedestrian , it's clich ? d .  carpenter's need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation .  we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ?  and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here .  carpenter's script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness .  this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around .  the second lamest device , of course , is the , " oh , it was all a dream " resolution .  and guess what ?  this movie has both !  not that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile .  since there's no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere .  that's a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples .  carpenter can't even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it .  [the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats .  -ed . ]  when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts .  and when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint , they're fully clothed .  regardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity .  why wouldn't they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ?  why would they shower in their clothes ?  what if they weren't covered in latex paint ?  the cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes .  i felt sorry for affleck , who i've liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty .  dushku , who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality , has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan .  as for sagemiller ( star of the aforementioned get over it ) , i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person , and not an object for gawking .  and i'm not even getting into luke wilson's role as a priest .  at least he's friends with wes anderson .  bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it .  
0 phew , what a mess !  for his fifth collaboration with director rich- ard donner ( lethal weapon i-iii , maverick ) , mel gibson plays a motormouth , maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie , jerry , whose wild conspiracy theories are all but ignored by alice ( julia roberts , acting all serious ) , the justice department employee that he has a crush on .  she not interested , but another person is : a cia psychiatrist ( patrick stewart ) who promptly kidnaps him .  is one of jerry's conjectures correct ?   * is * the metal strip in the new $100 bill being used to track your movements ?  is oliver stone still alive , because he cut a deal with george bush to spread * dis * information ?  is this movie really about * any * of the crazed cabbie's theories ?  no , no , and no .  as it turns out , there's some other nonsense going on here , involving and revolving around jerry's background .   ( hint : pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out and flashes back , in quick succession , to images of an interrogation room , hypodermic needles , and ms . roberts herself . )  the * initial * premise is pretty good and is played , for a while , at a delightfully dizzying clip .  mel is wider-open that we've ever seen him and , if his character's relationship with roberts' initially strains credibility , their combined star power is blissfully intoxicating .   ( the highest wattage of the summer , perhaps ? )  even when the plot contrivances begin to intrude , the two remain a randy dandy screen pair .  there's a great scene in jerry's fortress , er , apartment , with alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host tries to remember the combination to a locked coffee bean container .   ( which he stores in another locked con- tainer , his fridge . )  other hilarious moments , of which there are many , include a trio of memorable convention-breakers , where alice ditches a tail , jerry cold-cocks someone , and , later , eludes a foot pursuit , each in a uproariously unexpected fashion .   ( that's donner's own ladyhawke playing in the theater , btw . )  let's see , other pleasures include . . .  a brilliant title sequence , a jazzy score from carter burwell , and the worth-paying-to-see sight of roberts pumping lead into one bad guy and slamming another's head into a wall .  oh , pretty woman !  getting to the latter , however , requires slogging through an increasingly overburdened and ultimately unappealing story .  the last hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable to torturous to almost unwatchable .  more stuff happens of the stupid shit variety than is worth mentioning here , except , perhaps , for a late sequence that has alice locating jerry in an abandoned wing of a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts .  and here i thought it was wabbit season .  good god , who rewrites these movies ?  and do they arrive in nondescript black vehicles ?  
0 the general's daughter is a heartless , absurd film , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters .  director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth .  what's worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm .  john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) .  brenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth's mentor , colonel moore ( james woods ) .  soon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who .  ebert's law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story .  perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it's painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something .  on a story level , the general's daughter is ineptly constructed .  the film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille's novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and " shocking " plot developments .  having not read the novel , it's difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree .  scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines .   ( sunderland actually asks brenner , " why was she killed ? "  to which i would have answered , " if i knew , then the movie would already be over . " )  only after we've spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored .  not that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot .  in one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask .  she sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring .  instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner's houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap .  this scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it's gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film's complete disregard for the characters and the audience .  it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise .  i realized that these constructs on screen aren't actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story .  this would have been bad enough without the west's need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct .  compelling films about sexual crimes don't spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don't show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture .  these scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they're intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be .  in addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it's a perversion of everything we know to be pure .  this standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up .  as it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane .  perhaps the only positive elements in the general's daughter are a couple of the performances .  james woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety .  i also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous .  nonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization .  the general's daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments .  
1 the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages .  martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime .  unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies .  seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime .  this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s .  goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) .  the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york .  at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands .  after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) .  three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history .  wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business .  but the perfect world of " wiseguys " gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends .  goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory .  scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker .  world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating .  scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny .  after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens .  scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience .  with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era .  even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker .  first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue .  then , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards .  this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation .  same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack .  nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s .  but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed .  however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people .  such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s .  fragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese .  he uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious " a day in life " segment near the end of the film .  another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents .  the most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues .  joe pesci deserved his " oscar " for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film .  ray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film .  liotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs .  liotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction .  lorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband .  paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave .  as a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time .  because of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s .  
0 and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn't pretty .  this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas's the three musketeers .  by bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting .  the end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu .  the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay .  d'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer .  he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents .  in paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu's man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks .  he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer's wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king's prison .  d'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day .  director peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it's a disaster .  one problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones .  jet li's high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around .  ironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes .  most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture .  the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader .  chambers' d'artangnan isn't a musketeer -- he's a mouseketeer !  and hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that's the only standout in an overall flat production .  
1 it's hard not to recommend " the others . "  the supernatural thriller , written and directed by alejandro amen ? bar ( " open your eyes " ) , adroitly establishes and maintains a low-key atmosphere of menace .  the cinematography , by javier aguirresarobe , is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances .  but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied .  overall , the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old " twilight zone " episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented , only to learn they are actually a child's toy , a military test subject or a department store dummy .  watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter , i always wanted to shout , " get on with it ! "  as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in " the others , " my reaction was much the same .  set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii , the story focuses on grace ( kidman ) , who tends to her children anne ( alakina mann ) and nicholas ( james bentley ) and worries about her husband , charles ( christopher eccleston ) , a missing serviceman .  anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors , protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time .  at the beginning of the film , three servants , mrs . mills ( fionnula flanagan ) , young , mute lydia ( elaine cassidy ) , and mr . tuttle ( eric sykes ) , an aging gardener , join the family .  the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first , but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not .  to make matters worse , the children are upset : nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts .  grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home , only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them .  that's essentially the whole story , with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear .  earlier , there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside , only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog .  the visuals in the otherworldly sequence , courtesy of aguirresarobe , are simply astounding .  i also enjoyed the presence of religion , a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural .  grace is a christian and answers her children's questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper .  when mother is away , though , the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore , just as real children do .  but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending .   " the others " sets out to be a classic ghost story , but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist .

( while the depiction is not biblically accurate , it is entertaining and might be excuse enough to familiarize ourselves with the true record by reading what is written in genesis 7 . )  a positive note is that the studio has avoided any segment which is as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended .  there are some images based upon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighi's pines of rome or images which have their roots in mythology such as the ethereal creatures which tell the story of nature's cycle of life , death , and rebirth in igor stravinsky's firebird suite .  but the stories they tell are uplifting , containing nothing too frightening for our younger children .  the darkest segment , spiritually speaking , actually belongs to the only holdover from the original fantasia , mickey mouse in the sorcerer's apprentice by paul dukas .  but overall , the emotions evoked from fantasia 2000 are positive ones , being full of hope and promise .  music has an impact which can be undeniably felt , capable of leading the listener to emotional peaks and inspirational highs simply not attainable through other mediums .  it is no wonder that the levites , as the priestly tribe of the old testament , were also the appointed musicians .  if fantasia 2000 is able to introduce a new audience to music which inspires and exalts , it will have done an incredible service .  
1 let's say you live at the end of an airport runway .  large jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace .  let's say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home .  now let's say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it's worth .  wouldn't you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ?  of course you would .  but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ?  that's what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he's happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it's not for sale .  unfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice .  not about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back .  the castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i've seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest .  in fact , it is this film's reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful .  the good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets .  it's the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn't have to think all that much while watching this film .  i just sat back and enjoyed myself .  the situation is one we've seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever .  what makes this film different is its characters .  darryl thinks he's got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he's got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard .  steve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for " investments " like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto's incompetent courtroom maneuvers .  the great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren't so stupid that they get annoying .  they're just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing .  we look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection .  screenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans .  sympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family's wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them .  i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works .  i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs .  don't get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius .  it's just that too often , a film will resort to it's use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully .  instead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world .  when they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious .  one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though .  the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film's running time .  luckily , it's a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film's main drive , is still quite enjoyable .  with all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes .  i'm not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate .  and , for that matter , it's more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this .  
1 a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins .  it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie " fingers " coyle ( mitchum ) .  he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment .  his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn't think he could survive prison at his age .  he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare .  he could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , but he figured he would never live if he did that .  he is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) .  the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it .  on one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm .  coyle's best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender .  he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs .  with the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time .  he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain .  thinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence .  but foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer .  warning : spoiler follows in next paragraph .  the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend .  the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up .  coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , " to be young like that and have his future , he's the greatest hockey player in the world . "  dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston .  this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next .  the city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder .  there is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat .  mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot .  it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them .  mitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor .  but in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle .  
0 i've always been a kevin kline fan , silverado , fish called wanda , pirates of penzance , and even his hamlet on pbs' great performances .  the minute i saw the trailer for this film , i resolved to see it .  besides the fact that kline starred , it looked like a hilarious film .  i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent , however , as i also thought , " wow , if there's this much funny stuff in the trailer , there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film . "   ( oops ) i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo ( my name for our local multi-multi-plex . )  the film began . . . .  the film concerns an english/drama teacher at a suburban high school , named howard brackett .  he loves poetry and great literary works , but his class is more interested in his famous former student , played by matt dillon .   ( i'd put in his name , but my wife won't let me take notes during a movie and i've forgotten it . )  they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him .  brackett has been engaged to another teacher ( played by joan cusack ) for three years , and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her .  the wedding , however , becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual .  kline spends most of the first two-thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn't .  the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference .  his closest friends don't help matters , bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party .  there are some genuinely hilarous moments , one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity .  kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck , who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out , while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations .  the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding .  kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows . . .  if you want to be surprised , don't read , i am going to reveal the ending .   . . . instead of saying " i do " in front of his parents and most of the town , and even some cameras , he says " i'm gay . "  this is where the movie , in my opinion falls apart .  most of the humor in the film had come from kline's insistence that he was straight , while at the same time , loving poetry and being a senstivie guy , dressing well , and occaisionally acting prissy .  it reminded me of the " effeminate heterosexual " sketch from saturday night live .  it was funny , it was sustainably funny , and kline's performance made it doubly so .  however , after the wedding , the film drags on .  they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion , but it then gets into the serious side of what he's done .  he reconciles with his parents and his friends , some of which had turned on him .  there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time , the scene with his mother and her friends , which was hilarious , seemed pointless , and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless .  finally , even though i am not catholic , i found the scene with the priest to be condescending .  the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship , proclaiming to brackett in the third person , " he's gay . "  it got a chuckle from the audience , but i was distracted by it , and began to tire of the film .  by the time the wedding had come and gone , i found myself hoping it would be over soon .   ( much like this review you are saying )  overall , if i have to quantify it , i say , rising action gets * * * * and climax and falling action gets .  see it in economy time .  
1 the happy bastard's 30-second review :  american pie  the summer of raunch continues to spread into theatres with this latest yuk fest , filled with sick jokes and teen dialogue aplenty .  if you go expecting dawson's creek , you're in for a problem .  if your expectations are lower ( and better , i might add ) , you will enjoy the hell out of american pie .  the movie casts several unknowns , with the only real recognizable one being sctv's own eugene levy as a happy-go-lucky dad .  the story revolves around four high school seniors who have one goal before the school year gets out- get laid .  that's pretty much it .  throughout the movie , little sick comic bits are sprinkled throughout , including a memorable scene involving an apple pie ( i won't give it away , but you probably know what it is ) and an internet broadcast gone horribly awry .  of course , the movie has some slightly sentimental bits , but they don't drag the movie's humor content down that bad .  most of the actors get their job done , but it's levy who's a hoot , a father who tries to talk sex with his son with the help of some curious " visual aids " .  i couldn't stop laughing during this movie , and if you can stand all the raunch and the sex references , then american pie is for you .  if you're one of those " conservative " types , well , i'll bet you're having fun at home while this , south park , and austin powers ii plays in theatres , now aren't you ?  
1 _in brief : _ this film needs no introduction .  if you haven't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven't seen it -- well , i suspect you're in a small minority !  first thing's first ? is it all it's hyped up to be ?  well , yes ? and no .  it's a good film , and there's a lot to like about it , but it's not without its problems .  when i saw the first trailer for " titanic " , it was when i went to see " bean " last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? !  i mean , what's happened to hollywood's script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ?  gads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ?  i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn't alone in that respect .  it's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice !  i didn't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) ,  so i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn't think i'd enjoy it much .  did i ? yes and no .  mainly yes , i'm happy to say .  the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the " human " aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting .  the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a' course !   : - ) ) .  well , it's an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat .  does it work here ?  in script form it doesn't add all that much to the story .  what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film .  her presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her .  also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving .  it's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack's " rescuing " rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching .  in fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance .  it's engaging , touching and very enjoyable .  there's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it's not going to be a happy ending .  which leads us to the second half of the film .  we all knew it was coming .  i'm sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he's stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film .  i think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die .  the iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour .  and it is an hour .  my goodness , we don't miss a second of that hour ?  gratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today's standards , i'm sure there's been far worse produced under the banner of " entertainment " in other films .  but i certainly wasn't prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be .  not that i'd expect the word " understatement " to be part of cameron's vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as " terminator 2 " and " aliens " ) .  is it overdone ?  i thought so .  understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy .  no , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn't quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film's second half .  still , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears !  you really couldn't help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose's overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive .  perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface .  the bit where rose lets go of jack's hand , while promising she'll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it .  i loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half .  so , we've established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive .  haven't mentioned the script .  plot-wise it's ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i've a feeling that's to the actors credit if anything .  as for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 .  it's a period drama .  but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned .  did they really use phrases like " goddamn it ! "  back in the turn of the century ?  i doubt it .  would someone talk like this : " do ya love the guy or what ? " .  i doubt it .  is such dialogue as " i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now " not just a bit ? clumsy ?  yes it is .  a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) .  stick with directing , dude .  but its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast .  star of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn't she win that oscar ? !  after all , they were throwing oscars at " titanic " left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee .  directing-wise cameron does a spectacular job .  like i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well .  i haven't even mentioned james horner's beautiful score .  utterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it !   ; - )  i've finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would !  just leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ?  hell , don't talk to me about oscars .  bloomin' farce .  it was deserving in a number of departments , though .  last question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ?  nope , i don't think so .  it's certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i've ever seen , but i don't think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites .  and as for the fact they're reportedly making a " titanic 2 " ? well i guess that's typical hollywood for you !  
1 i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival .  'holocaust comedy receives standing ovation' , the headlines read .  intrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years .  even though the movie was extremely well-received by critics and public alike , i couldn't help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated .  only now do i see the error of my ways .  after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a " holocaust comedy " ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps .  rather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation .  roberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse ) .  through the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this " beautiful princess " , as he calls her .  employing the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini ) .  life treats them well until hitler's minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son's innocence no matter what the sacrifice .  granted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a " hogan's heros " and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews .  somehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it's gravely serious subject .  so , we've established that life is beautiful is not a " holocaust comedy " .  but , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me .  the film , despite critic's declarations of it being a " triumph of the human spirit " , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway .  some have called the story an " affirmation of the beauty of life " , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man's capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy .  the film's ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting .  essentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film .  however , i am not denying the movie's greatness .  believe me , it's fantastic .  i'm just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as .  but perhaps i'm reading more into the movie than is really there .  maybe the film's brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit .  in fact , maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it .  
1 ingredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python's spanish inquisition  synopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ?  believe it .  sliding doors is a love 'what if' story .  the gimmick is that it's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions .  in the beginning , likeable gal 'helen' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job .  so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch ) .  helen doesn't know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future .  the film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories .  in story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train .  arriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) .  this leads to a life where helen moves out .  helen's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business .  in story two , helen experiences a different fate .  she misses the train , never meets james , and doesn't get home early enough to discover gerry's infidelity .  in this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry .  will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ?  opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks .  at last here's proof that there's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking .  sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year .  not only is it a well-acted , heartwarming film , but it's also easily gwyneth paltrow's best recent performance .  when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she's talking about !  nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes .  nobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , " i will find you no matter what , my darling ! "  when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she doesn't take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she's supposed to be recovering from heartache .  and handsome live-in boyfriend gerry isn't the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob ) .  instead he's a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk .  another example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the 'hospital miracle' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation .  in other words , all of the characters seem non-stereotyped , human , and local .  there are minor inconveniences .  since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it's occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two .  distinguishing between the two stories isn't a problem in the scenes containing paltrow , who sports two different hairstyles .  but in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it's slightly confusing .  also , quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture ( seinfeld , woody allen , etc . ) are spoken by the british characters .  but these seem slightly forced , given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang .  possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable ?  sliding doors is a charming , quirky , original , happy romance with a little 'philosophy of fate' thrown in .  monty python and the meaning of fate , anybody ?  
0 by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered .  after all , writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines .  the first finds amarillo , texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction .  as olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects .  lane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination .  all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other's protagonist .  but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse .  lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years .  he's not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they've got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise .  two months earlier , lacrosse's own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere .  lacrosse knows his killer's work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game .  it wouldn't be fair to reduce everything that's wrong with switchback to quaid's presence , but it's a pretty good place to start .  there's a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation .  we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he's grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp .  a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film .  quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated .  it's tough to become emotionally invested in a character's turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes .  even without quaid , it doesn't appear that switchback would have stayed on course .  the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat .  unfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal .  once the mystery of the killer's identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable .  in fact , " stale and predictable " describes the direction that switchback takes in general , falling back on far-too-common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere , a climactic fistfight on board a freight train , and edgy law enforcement agents .  it's too bad stuart wasn't willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film .  played with atypical restraint by r . lee ermey , he's a wonderful , unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions .  a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling .  instead , stuart places his trust in a " name " star who can't carry the material .  maybe next time he'll throw away that one crucial page in the script , the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story .  
0 dr . alan grant ( sam neill , " jurassic park " ) is becoming disillusioned .  paleontology is no longer the sexy science it once was since the ingen corporation cloned his subject matter .  his lectures bring people interested in his adventures on isla nubla rather than his research and funding dollars are drying up .  when the kirbys ( william h . macy , " fargo " ; tea leoni , " the family man " ) ask him to be their guide for an anniversary flyover of isla sorna ( the notorious site b of " the lost world " ) he's disdainful , but once they wave their checkbook , he reconsiders .  however the kirbys haven't given dr . grant their real agenda in " jurassic park iii . "  of course , we , the audience , have been tipped off , given that the film begins by showing us eric ( trevor morgan , " the patriot " ) , a young boy , and ben ( mark harelik , " election " ) going for a paragliding adventure off that same island that goes awry ( and looks like cheesy rear projection ) .  grant's established back home with a new right hand man , billy brennan ( alessandro nivola , " love's labour's lost " ) on site at a dig in montana sorely lacking funds .  he also pays a visit to old flame dr . ellie sattler ( laura dern , " jurassic park " ) , now married to another with a young son who calls grant 'the dinosaur man' apparently for the sole purpose of dredging her up again for the film's poorly imagined finale .  grant takes billy along on the kirbys trip , which is really an illegal gambit to save their son , that young paraglider .  the couple aren't millionaires , making grant's check bogus , and they're separated as well ( eric was with amanda's new boyfriend , not that that makes much sense ) , meaning we're in for some gooey family dynamics while waiting for the dino dining .  the kirbys hired hands ( and obvious bait ) are a threesome led by mr . udesky ( michael jeter , " the gift " ) .   ( didn't anyone consider that casting michael jeter and william h . macy together and not having them be related was a little odd ? )  as directed by joe johnston ( " october sky , " " jumanji " ) ( spielberg only produced this one ) from a risible script by peter buchman and the " election " team of alexander payne & jim taylor , " jurassic park iii " is nothing more than a quickie monster flick with a couple of new dinos ( a spinosauraus , which goes head to head with the t-rex , and pteranodons ) .  the plot , as it were , is a series of coincidences combined with extreme leaps of faith and a trifecta of stupid cell phone tricks .  the effects are no longer new , and , as shot by television cinematographer shelly johnson , rather murky looking at times .  film editing by robert dalva ( " october sky " ) was presumably done by machete , to keep this down to a 90 minute run time .  i know of no other reason to explain the ridiculous ending which features the survivors confronting a pack of raptors , then being saved by the most ludicrous of logic jumps within a few minutes .  'original' music by don davis just repeats john williams' original themes .  while neill and young morgan attempt to inject some humor and humanity into the proceedings , the rest of the cast are plodding unexceptional .   " jurassic park iii " will probably provide some quick entertainment for those who go into it knowing what to expect , the same crowd who maybe liked " the lost world : jurassic park . "  
1 time bandits , from director terry gilliam , is a very different fantasy action/adventure movie about a group of time-traveling dwarves , led by randall ( david rappaport ) , who have stolen a map of the universe .  this map contains time hole , that , if exploited , enable the men to travel back and forth through time .  the supreme being of the universe ( ralph richardson ) is the former employer of these treasure-seeking bandits , and he wishes desperately to regain the map . .  during the travels , he appears as a ghostly face , demanding that they return the map that they have stolen .  but , according to randall , they are just " borrowing " it .  kevin , a young boy who seems quite bored with his life , is unexpectedly brought into the schemes of the little men when they appear in his room , which has a portal for time traveling .  he joins up with the men and becomes part of their gang , following them on their robberies .  their first victim is napoleon ( ian holm ) , whom they rob during a battle that he is commanding .  from here , the group travels to the middle ages , meeting up with robin hood himself .  eventually , kevin is separated from the group and travels to an egyptian time where he is taken in by king agamemnon , played by sean connery .  kevin accidentally saved the king's life , and the king wishes to have kevin as his son .  but the group of bandits find kevin and transport onto the deck of the titanic .  meanwhile , the evil genius ( david warner ) is watching the group from fortress of ultimate darkness , attempting to find a way in order to bring the men , and the map , to him .  when randall learns of the fortress of ultimate darkness , which supposedly contains " the most fabulous object in the world " , the dollar signs seemingly appear on his eyes , as he is convinced that they must travel there .  once inside the fortress of ultimate darkness , it is unclear as to if any of the men will make it out alive .  time bandits is a fantastically made film that caters to the imagination of anyone .  with a terrific soundtrack , courtesy of george harrison , whom also was an executive producer , time bandits is sure to be a very surrealistic , time-traveling adventure with unforgettable characters that is sure to entertain anyone .  terry gilliam , however , does not utilize that greatly his trademark ability in moviemaking during this film , although this does not affect the film that greatly .  and finally , if you liked labyrinth , you'll love time bandits .  
1 after a stylistic detour with mrs .  parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption .  while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie .  it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it .  until mrs .  parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies .  i found equinox , his last pre- mrs .  parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating .  i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow .  there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach .  the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch .  in short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in .  afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples .  jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) .  for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level .  all she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating .  after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor .  the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne .  a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart .  they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs .  the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable .  the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey .  the two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool .  meanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains .  the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love .  sex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness .  ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves .  the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances .  jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman .  those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity .  lara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability .  nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease .  the clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis .  her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars .  i don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions .  enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters .  afterglow is basically a four-pronged character study .  the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture .  rudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction .  
0 the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as 'anywhere but here . '  there isn't one thing about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest .  it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives , as for some reason they couldn't figure it out for themselves .  if the film looks familiar , that is because " the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) " went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with .  alvin sargent's script was weak and annoyingly claustral .  wayne wang's ( " the joy luck club " ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn't convey .  pushy mother adele august ( susan sarandon ) forces her 14-year-old daughter ann ( natalie portman ) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross-country with her to beverly hills .  the daughter resents her twice divorced , unstable but exotic , schoolteacher mother , bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life .  the daqughter doesn't even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can't stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio .  so it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner .  adele's dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn't look that good , as she lands a job in a slum school , has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids , and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive .  daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there .  during one of many arguments with her free-spirited mom , they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed , she runs away , only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop ( michael milhoan ) , who offers her wise counsel .  with the cop's zen wisdom passed onto the daughter , she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla .  during their stay in beverly hills , she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer-- a t . s .  eliot ( corbin allred ) reader .  but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional .  when she learns her cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) , who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin , she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn't clearly shown why she wants to stay there , and for that matter , it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly .  the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams .  i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say , is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one , able to recognize mother's faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself .  mother has a series of setbacks , like being dumped by her dream-boat dentist ( bochner ) she met on the beach , and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part .  but mother learns that her daughter has grown-up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her .  she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do , is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do .  this of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom's heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way .  this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing .  
0 warner brothers has scored another marketing coup .  the one-two punch was started in the summer , with the release of batman forever .  trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat , ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel .  carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever-wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video ( $11 . 99 at wal-mart ) ; a mere two weeks before carrey's return in this marketwise , but misfired comedy .  ace ventura : when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubber-faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment .  he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher , in batman forever , but , here , left to his own devices , carrey quickly wears out his welcome .  the opening sequence is by far the best--an amusing spoof of cliffhanger , with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon .   ( you can guess what happens to mr . paws .  hint : it sounds like splat . )  the plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas , and then to not-so-darkest africa , where ace is on the case of a missing white bat .  with his hair and limbs both wildly askew , carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes .  the rest of the film is just more of the same .  sure , the plot's linear , and the production values solid , but where is the scripted humor to support carrey's sloppy slathering ?  writer and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set-ups .  instead , carrey just mugs away , playing for the camera even when most of it isn't funny .  the better gags have been shown in the ads , though a bit with ace emerging buck-naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see .  though an arguable improvement over the original , ace ventura : when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten .  the script is virtually devoid of wit .  tribal mask jokes ?  jerry lewis cameos ?  forget it .  if anything , the inexplicable presence of simon callow ( four weddings and a funeral ) and bob gunton ( the shawshank redemption ) suggests that working with carrey is the classical actor's ultimate challenge .  just how long * can * they keep a straight face ?  
0 first impressions : critically , a close-to-awful film , but money-wise , it has been doing ( and will continue to do ) great .  a sometimes-funny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring .  an orginal plot that grows old real fast .  one of the only 90 minute films that i've gotten bored through .  men in black has defied the odds .  when i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long , i thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas .  however , i now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas , but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off a very original idea ( which summer audiences have embraced ) that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie .  tommy lee jones and will smith play two " government " agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society .  the ridiculous plot begins when an alien " bug " , played weirdly by vincent d'onofrio , who was so great in full metal jacket , lands on earth to retrieve a galaxy that's somewhere on " orion's belt . "  anyway , the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy , or a higher power will blow up the earth .  the premise is ridulous , but that is not why i didn't like this film .  i love original plots .  this one had an original one .  but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot : he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films .  whenever i saw d'onofrio's bug stomp and eat people in the film , it got terribly boring after a while .  while smith's wise-cracks did fill in the gaps , it wasn't enough .  and also , i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a sub-plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent , they can't have contact with any humans really .  and here i see jones , at a satellite computer , watching his lover plant the garden ?  a sentimental moment in an alien movie ?  nice try , but i don't think so .  it doesn't work here .  it just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring : we don't only have aliens to worry about , but now we have jones's conscience .  i came into the movie not wanting to see jones's conscience , but wanting to see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it .  maybe it's unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were .  nevertheless , even though some parts are indeed funny , the plot in this movie grew old and boring -- quick .  
1 plot : jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy .  but one thing leads to another , and the next thing you know , li's being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working .  a lot of ass-kicking , face-whippings , gun fights and . . . okay , a little more ass-kicking ensues .  critique : very cool !  now here's a movie that gives you exactly what you're looking for , if what you're looking for is kickass action , a palpable good cop/bad cop story line , some hardcore stunts and jet li slam-dunking everyone in sight !  the film also moves fast ( a mere 95 minutes ) , develops a certain " cute " chemistry between fonda and li , has nice surroundings ( paris , baby ! ) and gives us one of the best bad guys that i've seen all year .  tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film .  he is pure evil .  they should have called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing on this man .  what a great , great monster !  my favorite line of tcheky's was when li was explaining the whole " kiss of the dragon " thing to him and he cut him off by saying " kiss my ass ! "  pure action movie poetry .  anyway , other than him , jet li also handled his " acting " pretty well in this film , with very little real dialogue to say , but enough to make us believe his character .  actually , just looking into the man's eyes generally tells you a lot .  fonda was also pretty good , despite playing one of the most trashy and abused women that i have seen in quite some time , but i still felt kinda bad for her , so i guess she did her job okay .  but in the end , nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances .  we go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side to side , and this film delivers gangbusters on that front .  and yes . . . they have no wire-fu in this movie . . . i  say again . . . no  wire-work , no bullshit stunts with li floating around in mid-air for over a minute .  it's all straight action , fist to fist , boot to face and all around cool stunts .  if that's what you're looking for , i don't see how you will be disappointed with this film .  yes , it's not very original in plot ( just take luc besson's own la femme nikita and mix in plenty of his own the professional et voila ! ) , does have an annoying hip-hoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a while ( i also would have gotten rid of the whole acupuncture thang . . . ) and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief , rolling their eyes all over the place .  but was i entertained ?  thoroughly .  does the film feature more gunplay , martial arts and over-the-top kills that most recent action flicks ?  yes , again .  does this sound interesting to you ?  well , the answer to that question is entirely up to you .  one thing that i would definitely recommend is , as jet li pointed out himself on his website , that you leave the kids at home for this one .  in fact , you might even wanna leave yourself if you can't handle the more violent of sequences .  all in all , a rippin' , roarin' fun time !  where's joblo coming from ?  black mask ( 5/10 ) - blade ( 7/10 ) - la femme nikita ( 8/10 ) - lethal weapon 4 ( 7/10 ) - the matrix ( 8/10 ) - the professional ( 9/10 ) - romeo must die ( 3/10 ) - rush hour ( 7/10 ) - shanghai noon ( 6/10 )  
1 capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg .  joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs .  it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure .  the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious .  i had a good time .   , low +2 ( -4 to +4 )  here goes my credibility .  this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority .  i liked the third jurassic park film .  i even liked the second jurassic park film .  in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle .  jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , " for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy . "  that is what all the jurassic park films are .  expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house .  the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also .  jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs .  the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting .  some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds .  that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require .  i feel i got my money's worth .  the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica .  this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park .  they hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height .  the height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not .  the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended .  flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide .  he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs .  but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go .  doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs .  they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn .  he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once .  right .  guess what happens next ?  jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 .  first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm .  sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first .  curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance .  one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time .  they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films .  of course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species .  not only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic .  in this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition .  this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized .  each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course .  in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty .  it has a crocodile's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright .  perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs .  sometimes they just move too fast to see .  occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision .  a few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory .  but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films .  the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams's score for the first film .  joe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky .  a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay .  the film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun .  if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you .  i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .  
1 susan granger's review of " songcatcher " in the midst of this summer's fare of dinos revisited and romantic fiascoes , there are a few thoughtful movies - and this appalachian period drama is one .  oscar nominee janet mcteer ( " tumbleweeds " ) stars as dr . lily penleric , an accomplished musicologist who , back in that pre-feminist era , was refused a full professorship at her university .  determined to prove her worth , she ventures deep into the rugged mountains of north carolina , where her younger sister elna ( jane adams ) runs a school .  there in bear creek , she discovers a treasure-trove of traditional scots-irish and english folk ballads , given a unique interpretation by the insular locals .  excited , she sends for recording equipment and persuades vinie butler ( pat carroll ) and other self-sustaining mountain folk to share their musical heritage on her edison phonograph cylinders .  their music , as she puts it , is " as much a part of life here as the air you breathe . "  that's the main thrust of writer-director maggie greenwald's occasionally uneven culture-clash story , which is loosely based on olive dame campbell's foray through the blue ridge mountains in 1908 , but there's also some melodramatic romantic spice .  ornery , bearded , banjo-picking aidan quinn falls for the statuesque , passionate " songcatcher , " while elna secretly engages in a lesbian relationship with a colleague ( e .  katherine kerr ) .  i'm ready to buy the soulful soundtrack with vocalists like emmylou harris , iris dement , taj mahal and young opera star emmy rossum who plays a pivotal role as mcteer's wide-eyed prot ? g ? .  rated pg-13 , there's an intense scene of primitive childbirth .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " songcatcher " is an intelligent , extraordinary 8 , transported by the transcendent power of song .  
0 a silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy , with its main asset being a beautiful film location along spain's mountainous coastline .  howard pigeon ( jeff goldblum ) is a 40-year-old mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to a wife constantly nagging him , elizabeth ( mimi rogers ) .  after a surprise birthday party for him , where his wife bawls him out for coming late to his surprise party , he confides to his best friend that he can't stand it anymore , and then tells him his plan to kill her while vacationing in the same barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon .  jeff is going through a severe mid-life crises , worried that he looks older than his age .  he incessantly talks to himself , mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for a second time , and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive .  he stutters and acts like a man who has lost his confidence .  things change on their vacation , as elizabeth makes an effort to be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch .  he nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room .  by accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting .  when other hotel guests and staff come to check about the gunshot , he nervously explains that it was the tv .  realizing how unworkable his plan is , he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth .  but elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip , and when after a great deal of effort to get a reservation at the hotel's 5 star restaurant he insists on eating in the room , she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him .  as a result , he goes to the police to report her missing .  while with the police , a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone .  his boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him , and he gets a job promotion .  but soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water , giving the police cause to arrest him and search his home .  there they find letters he has written incriminating him to the murder .  the police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room .  in jail , things look bad for him .  no one believes him , including his friends and lawyer .  his boss fires him and the papers have a field day with the headline story : pigeon : a jailbird .  out on bail , he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife .  through a call placed on his credit card , he tracks her down to a mountain resort .  once there he learns that she took a hike up the steep mountain and he gets a priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story .  the film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance .  he is someone coming apart by the seams , while mimi rogers is his perfect foil .  it was mostly pantomine humor , with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation .  a very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd .  the film just didn't take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it , so it had no chance for black humor to develop .  it instead played its set-up of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw .  
1 this movie was one of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven .  he has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers .  all of his movies have one main thing in common- they don't skimp on the violence .  in a verhoeven movie a guy doesn't get shot once in the chest- he gets shot many times all over the body .  robocop takes place in detroit in the future .  things are pretty bleak .  the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force .  peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner , nancy allen .  peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed .  meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed-209 model robot crime fighter .  someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after .  the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace .  it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off , but plot twists keep it exciting .  the acting is bad from weller when he is human , but very good when he is robocop .  nancy allen does a decent job .  this movie doesn't leave itself open for a sequel exactly .  but they made one anyway .  enter . . .  robocop 2 starring : peter weller and nancy allen directed by : irvin kershner  detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film .  ocp is trying to develop an improved 'robocop 2' that will be more than a match for criminals .  most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over , leaving robocop to be the police force in the city .  this film is pretty bizaare .  it has a 13 year-old drug-lord who curses as much as eddie murphy , even more violence than the original , and some more humor .  the plot of this movie is pretty large , almost too much so .  there are three or four plot lines weaving around that don't really match up .  the effects are still decent though .  this sequel isn't more of the same really , just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals .  if you liked the first one , watch this .  but be dissapointed .  so later comes . . .  robocop 3 starring nancy allen and robert john burke  ocp is now owned by a large japanese company .  robocop joins a band of rebels to counter-attack the evil empire , i mean ocp .  the japanese send a cyborg-ninja to deal with robocop .  among other things . . .  this movie is easier to follow than the last one .  which means the plot isn't quite as crowded .  this movie isn't anything special though .  just more of robocop blasting things up in a more kid-friendly way .  really not reccomended .  
0 `bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan .  to pull something like this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines .  something like the underground worm thriller `tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun .  with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , `bats' mainly plays it's premise for straight-arrow horror .  judging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move .  the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock's `the birds' , but fails miserably .  done right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema .  unfortunately , `bats' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong .  the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be .  i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats' is aimed toward .  those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats .  these bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people .  boy , are these bats ugly .  they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart .  they've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all .  a whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats .  they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it's sorta hard to do .  the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good .  but no , `bats' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers .  the film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores .  on the small screen , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations .  but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure , the film is poorly written , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude .  even the bats themselves are cheesy , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed .  the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar , struts contentedly in his boots , etc . . . ) .  the scientist is dr . sheila casper ( dina meyer ) , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field' .  meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable , but everything about dr . casper is recycled beyond recognition .  her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper's tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws' .  everything revolving around `bats' is tired drivel , which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up .  the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw , with voices dubbed in later .  in fact , that may have worked out better in the end .  take one glance at casper's bat-loathing sidekick jimmy ( leon ) , and you'll have immediate deja vu - he's the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie , constructed specifically for timed comic relief .  unfortunately , none of his comic interludes are funny .  in the role of deranged mad scientist dr . mccabe , the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch .  mccabe `accidentally' released two experimental test subjects , and the virus spread to other bats .  the entire town of gallup , texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures , but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else .  something like : `when is the damn movie going to be over ? ?  i just want my money . '  the bats are ugly , i must say .  there's the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing , but mainly , the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery .  only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been , but by the absurdly stupid climax , it's way too late in the game for a decent recovery .  characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire .  let's explore the logic there : is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population ? ?  you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one , and after that there are only 18 , 000 more of them .  this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind `bats' .  
1 capsule : suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick , which isn't necessarily a bad thing .  not exactly oscar caliber , but one helluva bullet-riddled good time .  extended review : you know , i remember when hitmen were evil , murderous scum .  alas , the times are a-changin' .  in a recent string of movies , hitmen are suddenly wise- cracking , fun-loving killers-with-hearts .  this brings us to hong kong director kirk wong's first american feature , the big hit .  oddly enough , about the same time last year a similar film , grosse point blank , was released .  advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action , it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it .  the big hit is quite the opposite .  it was hyped as " the new film from producer john woo " , so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action .  however , there's a sore lack of it , which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit .  the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver .  mel , played by mark wahlberg in a dopey , milquetoast role , is a killing machine ; he flips , spins , even breakdances whilst popping caps .  sadly , he doesn't get a chance to do much of it .  except for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so , the film is in comedy mode .  the action , at least what there is of it , is prime cut stuff .  wong , after numerous hong kong features , makes quite a nice u . s . debut .  however , his pacing is a bit off , with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough .  they start off electrifying and fresh , but just kinda stop .  normally , this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable .  luckily , we have ben ramsey's screenplay , a bitingly funny piece of work .  the only problem is there might be too much humor , one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few .  some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mel's hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism .  the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled , some being there only for a laugh , which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't .  overall , the big hit may have it's flaws , but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed , gut-wrenchingly funny joyride .  definately one of the better ways to spend two hours .  
1 jacques tati's 1953 classic " les vacances de m . hulot " ( also known as " mr . hulot's vacation , " in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film .  the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week's vacation .  yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory .  part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags .  slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don't watch where they're going .  in " les vacances de m . hulot , " the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key .  in one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat .  while crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it .  when he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues .  tati doesn't waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film .  it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience's expectations , and " les vacances de m . hulot " succeeds brilliantly in that area as well .  tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement .  when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark .  tati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , " oh , he's not going to do that again , " but , lo and behold , he does .  for example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot's noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel's lights coming on one by one .  then this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce .  the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy .  as much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did .  the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters .  it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons .  instead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem .   " les vacances de m . hulot " is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events .  anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store .  note : " les vacances de m . hulot " was not rated by the mpaa .  it would at most receive a pg rating .  
0 synopsis : blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs .  in the meantime , someone sends sarah rotting flowers , puts her name in the newspaper's obituary column , and kills her cat .  comments : never talk to strangers , a colossal waste of time , moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film .  one wouldn't think that two genuine movie stars , antonio banderas ( evita ) and rebecca de mornay ( hand that rocks the cradle ) , and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller ( " saturday night live " ) would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey .  not only are they in it , however , but de mornay executive produced it .  what was she thinking ?  never talk to strangers centers upon sarah , a psychologist examining the ill-tempered max , a murderer soon to stand trial .  she receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood .  two men woo her ; tony the " security consultant " wins her over ( so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music ) .  a lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder , but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah , and instead offers several male characters as red herrings .  86 minutes , the running time of this cinematic mess , thus , seem like 86 hours .  a good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony .  why would the career-minded , professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony ?  that's one of the film's mysteries which are never answered .  regardless of motive , de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism .  they also manage to go out before copulating occasionally -- in one of the stupidest scenes of the film , tony takes sarah to a carnival that's * right outside * his dingy apartment ( that way , they can hurry back and have sex quickly ) .  also , apparently , the weather changes quickly in their locale : they're at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex ; the next day , they're out playing in the snow before having sex .  the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah's " character development . "  someone is out to get poor sarah ( though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts ) .  rotting flowers , a writeup in the obituary , and a beaten neighbor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her .  suspense cliche number one also occurs : whenever someone is stalked in thrillers , by any means , if the stalked has a pet , that pet will die .  oftentimes , to even further the cliche , the murdered pet is a cat ( suspense filmmakers , for some reason , just don't like cats ) .  sarah , in never talk to strangers , receives a package and , lo and behold , discovers her mutilated cat within .  suspense at its very derivative !  as stated before , never talk to strangers is a poor excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas and de mornay's bodies as often as possible .  comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here ( he's not given lines that are suitable for his persona ) and doesn't even appear all that much .  maybe , in a way , he's lucky for that .  early on in the movie , sarah tells tony , after meeting him in a supermarket , that she had been advised to never talk to strangers .  allow me to advise that you never watch this stinker .  
0  " nothing more than a high budget masturbation fantasy "  showgirls ( nc-17 ) - contains graphic nudity , profanity , sexual situations and violence .  some people , however , keep their clothes on .  you do not watch porn films for their intellectual values , nor do you write reviews on them .  that's why this review will be short .  it seems that this film will end up in the porn section when it hits the video stores .  there is no story , script , point or acting .  only naked bodies , which is exactly the point .  here is the so called plot : nomi , the 23-year-old with a dark past as a hooker , has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform in a show where a dancer doesn't wear much more than a light coating of powder and a big , fake smile .  no one is twisting nomi's arm .  no one is holding her grandmother hostage .  she wants to do this .  and that is what she is doing till the end credits .  so what's the problem then ?  what's the point ?  what's the film about ?  is there anyone whose aspirations could inspire less sympathy ?  this film can be described in one sentence : obscene level of incompetence , excessive stupidity in the story line , gross negligence of the viewer's intelligence , a prurient interest in the quick buck .  believe me , after an hour with these characters , acting and script , you'll start hoping for someone to kill somebody .  elizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as the heroine of this film , that is bad even for eszterhas' script .  her character is the only one that is at least half written and she could really have done better .  her character denies the fact that she is a whore for the industry , selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public .   " i am not a whore !  i am a dancer " , she screams , but does it in such an over dramatized way that you'll start laughing .  in fact the acting in " showgirls " brings terrible to a new and previously unknown level .  not one single achievement , besides the conventional cinematography , is worth mentioning .  it is a total waste of time and money .  there is not a single moment of what you might call intelligence .  the dialogue is structured of ancient stereotypes and cliches lined up one after another .  its attempt to even imagine to have half a brain results in a catastrophe .   " in my films , " writes director paul verhoeven ( 'basic instinct' , 'total recall' ) , " i hold the mirror up to life . "  well , excuse me ?  his attempt to go behind the scenes of las vegas , and as he put it " show the naked truth " , is simplified and unreal .  occasionally , between his collection of mistakes and logical irrationalities , screenwriter joe eszterhas ( the creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history ) inserts some lines of deep morality , that sound something like this : " hey , i see you .  i see that you're hiding " - " from what ? "  - " from you " .  yes , and even the only decent line in this film : " nomi is what las vegas is all about " can't save 'showgirls' from going under .  it's a strange phenomena .  it's not erotic , because it lacks sensuality .  not dramatic , because it lacks the acting .  and not intelligent because it lacks a story .  it is simply verhoven's bad excuse for making pornography .  you want to see naked women ?  bare breasts ?  full frontals ?  it's nothing wrong with that .  but in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video store , and not waste time surviving through eszterhas' pathetic dialogue .  b qualities , while it's only a high budget porn-film .  
0 if the 70's nostalgia didn't make you feel old , the 80's nostalgia is bound to .  one of the latter set , " the wedding singer , " seems to be written by someone who did not experience the 1980's directly but only read about them in an article in parade magazine .  the wacky fashions are here .   .   .  and the music .   .   .  and references aplenty to celebrities and signs of the times , but it all seems tediously-and too obviously-inserted for the didn't-we-dress-funny-back-then chuckle .  the plot is standard romantic comedy with nothing original : robbie ( adam sandler ) is a wedding singer ; julia ( drew barrymore ) waits tables at weddings .  both are engaged ; however , robbie's fiance ( angela featherstone ) dumps him at the altar , and julia's fiance ( matthew glave ) is a skirt-chasing speculator in junk bonds .  robbie and julia go through the expected ups-and-downs as they realize they were meant to be together .  i'll fess up-i've never found adam sandler funny .  whatever his appeal is , i've missed it .   ( other comedians i don't get include pauly shore and pee wee herman-make your own judgments ) .  the stupidity and artificiality of the whole project is summarized in a cameo by billy idol as himself .  idol looks like hell , and the ravages of his lifestyle are barely concealed by thick makeup .  he's mocked by a photo of his younger self on a rolling stone cover in the same scene .  we're not supposed to notice that , and we're not supposed to notice how silly it is that billy idol suddenly appears to play fairy godmother to robbie .  other cameos , by steve buscemi and jon lovitz , provide the only real laughs in the movie .  lovitz is especially good , playing a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain to take advantage of robbie's post-break-up depression .  
0 as with any gen-x mtv movie ( like last year's dead man on campus ) , the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points : sex and football .  those two items , wrapped in a guilty-pleasure package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales will decline for two reasons .  first , the football sequences are nothing new , nor can they be ; the sports genre isn't mainstream and it's been retread to death .  second , the sex is just bad .  despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all-night strip-club party , there's nothing even remotely tantalizing .  the acting is mostly mediocre , not including the fantastic jon voight .  cultivating his usual sliminess , voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer .  kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes' twenty-two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years ; this year he plans to make it twenty-three .  unfortunately , when his star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , goes down for the count , he's got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon ( james van der beek ) .  moxon leads the team through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom , the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie ( amy smart ) , and other temptations that abound in football-crazy west canaan .  most regions of the country are not nearly as football-crazy as texas , and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most .  similarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer .  these elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv's core audience is the high school demographic .  this focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv's " dawson's creek , " is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role .  other stars are similarly young and unmemorable .  there's not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there's not much to like about it , either .  everything herein has already been done , and if it hasn't , the movie manages to botch it one way or another .  this is certainly missable .  
0 starship troopers is a bad movie .  i mean , a really , really , bad movie .  not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) .  looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme .  that being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who's logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth .  the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) .  as the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another's hand .  eventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet .  as our faster than light travelling " heroes " arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . .   " what ? "  you say , " laser beam weapons ?  sonic weapons ?  phasers ?  photon cannons ? " .  nope , they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns , pump action rifles , and tactical nuclear weapons !  i guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry .  as the assault begins , our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon .  two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them , and one even sees a streak fly by , but disregards it as nothing .  this of course , leads to more massive carnage , blood shed , and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies .  again , i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons !  in the end , we see neil patrick " doogie howser " harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat , hat , and gloves .  he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug , and then proclaims that the bugs are scared !  this sets the troopers into a frenzy , as they are now one step closer to completing their goal , total genocide of a species ( again , sound familiar ? ? ) .  i have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review , but given it's non-existence , i may have anyway .  i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart , but don't want to bore you too badly .  in short , i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro-nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies , a drivers education accident scene film , and a complete blank screen ( the plot , of course ) .  i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone , anywhere , under any circumstance .  copyright ( c ) 1997 tim jandt " >  
0  " deep rising " gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films .  while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring's " anaconda " -- " deep rising " has no tongue to put in its cheek .  folks , we're only a month into the new year , and already here's a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases .  most of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh-oh -- if these people had seen " titanic , " then maybe they'd have known to stay home ) when it's attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature .  the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke janssen ) , argonautica owner canton ( anthony heald ) and a few other crew members .  a mercenary team , lead by resourceful captain john finnegan ( treat williams ) , board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby .  but what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood-soaked , hungry and not very helpful .  the main problem with " deep rising " is its overt familiarity ; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in recent memory .  the concept is " leviathan " meets " titanic , " with a dash of " speed 2 " thrown in for good ( or is that bad ? )  measure .  this monster is equal parts " 20 , 000 leagues under the sea " and " the relic , " knows how to open doors like the raptors from " jurassic park " and even gets to expel a half-digested victim ( a neat effect , admittedly ) a la the giant snake in " anaconda . "  some of the attack sequences are straight out of " jaws " and " alien . "  a scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of " alien resurrection . "  there's even a jet ski chase like " hard rain . "  and the list goes on .  watching " deep rising " 's cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself , because none of them have well-developed characters , nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy .  williams is affable enough , but his finnegan just isn't believable .  an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted ; pretty famke janssen , best known as " goldeneye " 's killer thighs , is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams , while kevin j . o'connor , as finnegan's mechanic , provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast .  djimon honsou , who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december's " amistad , " pops up in a brief part .  he needs to stay away from the water .  the movie's final shot is a groaner , as is the 11th-hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on-ship saboteur .  as if a cast deserving of their snack food-fate isn't bad enough ( when you taunt the monster , you're really asking for it ) , " deep rising " is a slow , stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot .  and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is , the closer we are to the end of the movie , rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn't out of the question .  
0 the thirteenth floor is a bland , obligatory exercise in genre film-making .  if i hadn't recently watched the matrix and open your eyes -- both of which are similar but far superior -- i might have been a little nicer to this picture .  craig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall , the rich co-creator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss ( armin mueller-stahl ) .  everything that was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one , and characters stare at each other for maddeningly-long periods of time and refuse to communicate on any realistic level .  the acting is okay , but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of , and features a script ( co-penned by director josef rusnak ) loaded with cliches and stock characters .  there are individual scenes and ideas that work -- i like the thought of a sentient computer program -- but none of the film's strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree .  producer roland emmerich , based on this and his previous directorial efforts , seems hell-bent on bringing us the ultimate standard in mediocre science-fiction .  
0 this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground , despite some good performances from a basically competent cast .  eddie ( sean penn ) and maureen ( robin wright penn ) are a not-so-happily married couple down on their luck .  living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city , they spend what little income they have at the local bar , owned by shorty ( stanton ) , eddie's best friend , and his wife georgie ( mazar ) .  maureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie's frequent disappearances .  on his return , he promises her the world and professes his undying love .  their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows , as eddie disappears again .  like a junky craving the next high , maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high .  their relationship is further complicated by maureen's pregnancy .  she wants the baby and the father , but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter .  during one of eddie's absences , maureen is attacked by kiefer , her neighbor , who gets her drunk ( with her cooperation ) and then insists on intimacy .  she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do -- not to her , but to kiefer .  she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage .  he lashes out as she expects , and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months -- but in reality is 10 years .  during this decade , maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual , joey ( travolta , in a small role ) .  her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her .  joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband ( and father of two children ) and stability ( joey makes a good living , drives a cadillac , and they live in a large house in the suburbs ) and the love of her previous life .  she chooses her past , and sacrifices not only her new life but her old ( by giving up her and eddie's daughter to joey ) .  but the eddie that she knew is gone , replaced by a mere shell of the man he was .  maureen is herself a mere shell , more an automaton than a woman -- as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him .  perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness ( or maybe the lack of sadness ) together , but the movie's denouement was not convincing .  
1 ok , let's get one thing straight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it's not too bad , really .  it's the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean-claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo's maiden hollywood effort , hard target ) .  in lam's film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians .  these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn't be noticed ) .  this brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . . well ,  you know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don't have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) .  moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) .  in little odessa , he meets mikhail's girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) .  this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think .  after all , one thing that's been missing from woo's hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) .  movies like this shouldn't be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too " big " in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle .  maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don't overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) .  the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don't make a hell of a lot of sense ) .  in fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv's " kids in the hall " ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story .  unfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . . well ,  you'll see .  the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots .  one is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka .  another , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw .  and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint .  of course , the movie does have its share of silliness .  for example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he's getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head .  in an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become .  but what has he become ?  a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ?  doesn't sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre .  but let's face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly .  so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films .  while watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics .  but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there's not much left .  although it's short on spectacle , lam's film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think .  i'm more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that's a good sign .  go see maximum risk , but don't expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong-hollywood action movie .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  dr t . white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore , but we don't hold this against him .  
1 okay , let me first say , this is a beavis and butthead movie .  if you do not like beavis and butthead , do not go to see this movie ! ! ! ! !  however , if you do like them , i recommened you get out right now and go see it .  the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv .  they notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it .  this wind their way through america searching for dallas ( she is a woman ) .  they look for her because as they are searching for the tv , they find a drunk who wants them " to do " his wife .  well , of course they think he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her .  and the fun starts their .  this movie is a mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off .  it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy .  i enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace .  even when they were crawling through the desert and i thought the movie started to lag , he manages to keep the laughs coming .  if you expecting changes from the show keep looking .  the same character , the same voices , the same everything from the show and that's what makes it good .  you might think with a movie from a tv show , you can change a few things .  often times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place !  
0 teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood .  every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular , and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights , wallets in hand .  the formula is very simple , you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal .  you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds , and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes , the typical teenage attention span .  the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to , and , most importantly , they don92t care to judge films=92 quality , so any piece of trash will = due .  that is just what never been kissed , the latest film from director raja gosnell , is ; trash .  josie geller ( drew barrymore ) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times .  she has her own personal assistant , unlimited supplies , and her own office .  but she is very much dismayed with her position in life .  there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field , where she can play a more active role in the chicago media .  so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere , she jumps at it with elation .  constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita ( molly shannon ) and her amicable superior , gus ( john c . reilly ) .  the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment , as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter .  however , since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict , this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes , and josie is headed for the field .  obviously , the field assignment involves a high school .  specifically , she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school , by enrolling in the senior class and " becoming one of them . "  i don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring , so i won92t .  the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school .  interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again .  fortunately for this lame production , other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting .  they include the predictable love stories , between both a student ( jeremy jordan ) and a teacher ( michael vartan ) , to show that josie is really two people in one body .  also , her younger brother and opposite , rob ( david arquette ) comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative .  the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing .  typical for teenage films , it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor .  one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical .  most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy .  but those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie .  following this trend of high school movie rules , comes the general acting .  it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film .  in this case , drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch .  she is required to play her character on two levels , having some very black and white transitions .  and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray , she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time .  at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel , and is expected to him on an adult level , since he is one , her teacher .  but she never seems to get out of the gray area , and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance .  following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon ( saturday night live ) .  she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to , and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic .  it is these " qualities " that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent .  luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film .  david arquette ( scream ) takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic , and not have his brilliant acting ruined .  and as a central character he gets to take on his own mini-plot , which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed .  in a dazzling cherry-on-the-sundae type piece of work , he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit , risky business .  never been kissed is a mediocre film at best .  the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood , that it is sickening to watch time and again , and this film is no exception .  the acting is just as bad , but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light .  unfortunately , the bottom line is that the movie will be a success , because teenagers will pay to see any trash .  
0 it happens every year -- the days get longer , the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big-budget blockbusters .  this year's crop already seems inferior to that of past summers , even 1997's lackluster trio of batman & robin , the fifth element and the lost world .  the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( " heeere , lee-zerd , lee-zerd . . . " ) , which doesn't make me optimistic about future summers .  godzilla is , of course , based on a series of cult movies ( translation : really bad movies only a few people can tolerate ) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner-owned cable stations .  that this big-budget remake won't rise above its roots is fairly obvious .  the credits show us the origin of godzilla .  in five words : nuclear explosion creates giant lizard .  sounds like an enquirer headline , doesn't it ?  the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable " discovery " sequence .  this time , a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling ( if that ain't a stereotype . . . )  when he discovers the telltale radar blip .  people die .  cut to our protagonist , played by matthew broderick .  he makes his first appearance wearing headphones , warbling along to " singin' in the rain . "  it's a none-too-subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie .  no dice , bueller .  from the beginning , poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla's enormous footprint .  every disaster movie has to have a know-it-all scientist , and this time broderick is it .  as the world's leading expert on radiated earthworms ( and wouldn't you love to have that printed on your business card ? ) ,  broderick is invaluable to the government .  he immediately dispels vicki lewis' theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because , hey , you can't take seriously the intellectual arguments of " newsradio " cast members .  broderick instead hits the nail on the head , announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard .   " the radiation isn't an anamoly , " he announces , and lightning strikes .   " i believe this is a mutated abberation , " he continues , and lightning strikes again .  it's vocabulary lightning , you see , activated by words of four syllables or more .  meanwhile , we're introduced to our new york cast , headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist ( maria patillo ) , broderick's former love .  gee , what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time ?  poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer .  italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she's not ruthless enough : " nice doesn't get you anywhere in this town .  it's dog eat dog . "  actually , it's lizard eat city , as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple's core .  the filmmakers provide us with a one-note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla .   " i think i've got a bite , " he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him .  you can guess what happens next .  similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city .  hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps , one new yorker remarks , " please don't tell me that's another parade . "  please don't tell me that's the best line you could come up with .  mayor ebert is not pleased .  played by the principal from " head of the class , " he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option , and bickers with his assistant gene .  i guess the filmmakers knew they'd be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didn't even bother to kiss ass .  the problem is , if you're going to attack siskel and ebert , you should at least make it funny .  dialogue like , " didn't we agree that we weren't going to have any sweets until after the election ? "  followed by , " back off , gene , " just doesn't work for me .  other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character's last name and frenchman jean reno's inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york .  there's even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses .  as the beast heads back into hiding , broderick suggests the military lure it out with food .  cue twelve dump trucks , all dropping fish into a new york intersection .   ( broderick : that's a lot of fish . )  that ambush fails , but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying $50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them .  yep , godzilla's with children , which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla .  that's until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually , like linda tripp .  godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day , so it has a lot of dumb action scenes , destructive special effects and shallow subplots .  look no further than patillo's betrayal of broderick ( patillo : what have i done , animal ?  what have i become ? ) and the climactic " godzilla's nest " sequence in madison square garden .  the main difference is , independence day was about the experience .  it had a real global , patriotic element to it , and some genuinely fun characters .  godzilla has lots of rain and lightning , reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak , blockbuster , juicy fruit , swatch , sprint and bumble bee tuna .  yes , bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla .  that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie .  
1  " when will the devil take me ? " he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over .  the spoiled title character of _onegin_ ( pronounced oh-negg-in ) is waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour .  martha fiennes' debut feature is ( quite literally ) filmed poetry ( it's based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin ) , a profound study of regret , of how we confuse shame with guilt .  when we first meet eugene onegin ( ralph , acting for his sister ; another brother , magnus , composed the score ) , a philandering aristocrat from st . petersburg , he has just inherited his uncle's estate .  with plans to sell it , onegin pays a summer visit to the manor , which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside , and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods .  smitten with olga larina ( headey ) , he befriends olga's fianc ? , vladimir lensky ( stephens ) , while olga's sister , tatyana ( tyler ) , romanticizing his flippant attitude ( he's a nineteenth bad boy ) , falls for onegin .  in one sweaty , inky torrent of passion , tatyana writes him a love letter .  he is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections , it is implied , because he can .  soon after , tragedy strikes , and onegin makes himself scarce .  when we catch up with him , six years later , he has just returned to st . petersburg , where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend ( donovan ) has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana .  this time , onegin finds her irresistable .  what is most amazing about ralph fiennes' performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch .  overwhelmed by a top hat , the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off , an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past .  the actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now-there's room to breathe in a role that's made up of shades of gray like " onegin " .  petula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in " parking lot " : " you don't know what you've got ? til it's gone . "  onegin's about-face on tatyana speaks for those of us ( read : most of us ) who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well .  what the character feels is not jealousy but remorse , embarrassment , even , at having let her go .  out of identification we feel empathy for onegin , a callous bastard .  tatyana's emotions echo a thousand ditties , but that makes them no less vital .  she changes , too , from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties .  tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co-stars , filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares .  they both have faces , mr . fiennes and ms . tyler , capable of conveying archetypal russian misery .  _onegin_ could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of " masterpiece theater " , even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact , were martha fiennes not at the helm .  an mtv background ( she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others ) has positively influenced her sense of pace ( though , thankfully , not her shot lengths-no spasmodic cutting here ) ; at just over 100 minutes , _onegin_ clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair .  the film has an atypical period look , as well .  absent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions .  the sets are almost expressionistically bare , echoing the loneliness of the protagonists .   ( cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them ; i'm reminded the climax , which unfolds in a sea of white . )  martha fiennes has a clear command of cinema , and her spare , often painfully human visual presentation of " yevgeny onegin " is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkin's difficult text yet .  ms . fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since jane campion .  
0 midway through " anaconda " , documentary filmmaker terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) turns to a co-worker and says " i thought this movie would be my first big break .  instead , it's turned into a disaster . "  truer words have never been spoken .   " anaconda " is a monster movie with a lousy monster .  it's a suspense film that is utterly predictable .  it's a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares , but only in the most elementary way , like a jack-in-the-box .  as you turn the crank , you're totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up , but somehow it's still mildly startling when it happens .  the main difference between the giant snake in " anaconda " and the clown in a jack-in-the-box is that the clown is more realistic .   " anaconda " boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years .  animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe- inducing robots you've endured at disney world .  but it's the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame .  in one shot , a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall , but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air .  the scene , if done well , would have been a jaw- dropper .  here , the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon .  what's really amazing is that the filmmaker's were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie .  but enough about the phony snakes .  now it's time to talk about the lousy story .  heroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians , a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest .  stoltz tells his crew " pray that you didn't forget your bug spray . "  apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff , because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no ill effect .  along the way , the group rescues a whacked-out lapsed priest ( jon voight ) who claims to know how to find the shirishama .  within minutes , they throw away all their plans and follow voight down a tributary into the land of creepiness .  from that point on , the film is a hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from " jaws " and " dead calm . "  one of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz .  early in the story , his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious .  so why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance ?  also , why did stoltz , who generally selects his roles with great care , agree to appear in this crap ?  ah , the mysteries of hollywood .  the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen .  jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary , but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters .  lopez , who starred in " selena , " is an enormously appealing performer , possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible .  ice cube has a special charisma ; an ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously .  there's also a special twinkle in his eyes , as if he's gently mocking his own tough-guy posturing .  but the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight .  obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas , voight plays the villain in thick accent , with a series of leers and hisses , spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of " jonny quest . "  at one point , he looms over the crew and says " the anaconda is the perfect killing machine .  it strikes , wraps around you , holds you tighter than your true love .  and you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode .   " that moment is so high-camp that it almost made the film tolerable .  almost .  fans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out " anaconda . "  don't .  there are a lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer , including another " alien " sequel .  wait for them , rent " jaws " in the meantime , and don't throw away your money and time on drivel like this .  
1 playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare's works .  they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ?  stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare .  and , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded .  shakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year .  it's so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written .  it could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you've ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it's likely that you'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love .  joseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he's a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life's more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc . ) .  he's commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson ) .  shakespeare , however , has trouble focusing on his work .  he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel .  this all changes , however , when he meets viola de lesseps ( a radiant gwyneth paltrow ) , a young heiress set to marry the financially-oriented lord wessex ( colin firth ) .  shakespeare instantly falls in love with her ; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo .  he discovers her identity and confronts her later ; she , of course , falls in love with him , although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex .  but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare's writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed .  shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter .  i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he's clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care .  he practically overflows with passion in every scene .  fiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i've seen her in .  the two performers work perfectly together , taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic , and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh .  of course , it doesn't hurt that they have a masterful script to work with .  stoppard , whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film , is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor ( all of his plays have similarly dry humor ) .  the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet .  one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie , shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid .  director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director .  i'm going to have to see the movie again ; i'm certain there are numerous references that i missed .  in fact , i doubt it's possible to gather everything with just one viewing .  stoppard is a master of detail : you'll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time .  there's also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe's mysterious death in a pub .  there's also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing .   " there's no dog in this play ? "   " no !  no dog ! "  the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year .  geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe ; wilkinson is also hard to recognize , but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously .  ben affleck , playing one of the actors in the company , shows great range , both in his accent ( his is almost as good as paltrow's ) and in humor ( he has some of the best one-liners in the movie ) .  colin firth , always stuck playing the sap , does a good job being hateful .  judi dench , however , has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth : rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words .  my single , minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end .  the story is moving , but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes .  but my quibbling is not important .  what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture , the sheer skill with which it has been written , acted , and produced .  shakespeare in love tries so many things , and nails every one of them : it's a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him , a film in which the actors , writers , and director are all perfectly in sync .  it's also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare's work in a positive way , without seeming condescending or superior .  i admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly , but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them .  not just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it .  
0  " book " should have remained in shadows  book of shadows : blair witch 2  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  certain things in our lives are inevitable .  death , sorrow , love , heartbreak , pain , joy .  we expect these events .  we know they're going to happen and some , we even look forward to .  it's part of the human condition .  we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society .  as we near the fall election , several of them are hitting us in the face .  politicians exaggerate their own importance .  our side is always right ; theirs is always wrong .  in the end , voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares .  in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money , there will be a sequel .  even if the original story doesn't merit one .  even if the first film is complete in itself .  even if success is a fluke .   " the blair witch project " was made with a budget of $1 . 75 and exploded on the screen , raking in huge profits .  the concept was brilliant .  the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real .  the film itself was even more convincing .  the movie _must_ be authentic .  why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen ?  the first film caught lightning in a bottle .  the sequel proves you can't pour that old lightning into a new bottle .  you have to give this effort some credit .  it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids .  it would have been easy , but of course , it wouldn't have worked .  instead " book of shadows " acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release .  it's a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel .  unfortunately it doesn't work either .  five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film .  weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives .  even weirder stuff happens .  some people die , there's blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense .  while supposedly doing serious research , the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation .  then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud , very obnoxious heavy metal music .  it's a bad plan .  the cast shows some early promise .  a couple is doing research on a " blair witch " book .  the tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficionado .  a goth amazon princess adds a bit of comedic relief .  the obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick , the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick : the cute wiccan chick .  the first film's unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods .  this time , these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors .  there's not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason .  although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea , it's ruined by poor execution .  the follow-up to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie .  they're trapped in an old big weird house .  they stupidly separate into various rooms .  there are strange noises , they see scary apparitions and people disappear .  ever see this movie ?  seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better .  the film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore .  for a storyline filled with surprises , it's oddly predicable .   " the blair witch project " was a rare triumph of style over substance .   " the book of shadows " is a triumph of tedium over promise .  
1 there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason .   " good will hunting " is about one of those people .  the will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let's face it , this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co-writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius .  he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino .  and he works at mit . . . as the janitor .  one day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( " breaking the waves " 's stellan skarsg ? rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete .  the next day , it's already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it .  so lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove .  and , duh , it's done again .  of course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will .  before lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy .  after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , " afternoon delight " ) .  finally , lambeau's old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up .  turns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not .  it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge .  and that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co-writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction .  is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ?  should this guy be forced to do something he doesn't want to do ?  this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should .  i'm not saying " good will hunting " is a bad film at all .  it's a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it .  the acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together .  we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will's love interest , skylar .  there are tons of individual moments that i adored .  i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them .  i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends .  there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch .  and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable .  like the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean's first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn't regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter .  however , the main flaw of the film is there's too much of everything , and not enough of it either .  the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they're sometimes either overwritten or underwritten .  take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face .  we hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times .  but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do .  also , will's relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action .  we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one .  their relationship never goes beyond " just best friends , " and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human .  maybe it was just me .  and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten .  and , of course , as in most films like this , the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten .  we never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it's there for plot details that anything else .  minnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character .  the writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness .  sure , it feels overstuffed , but it's extremely enjoyable .  the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human .  i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing .  while this is probably director gus van sant's most conservative film ( you'd hardly know it's the same director of " to die for , " the only van sant film i've seen , really ) , it's still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what's this " best picture " deal ? ) .  and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws , i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone .  
1 slavery is bad .  after hundreds of years , we've finally figured that one out .  this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg's latest " serious " film .  during the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa's west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery .  fifty-three of them are stuffed into the " la amistad " ( from a spanish word for " friendship " ) by their new spanish owners .  freeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt .  after killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think .  instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states .  the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy .  the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property .  if they are property , who do they belong to ?  their masters ?  the spanish government ?  salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ?  the us government ?  the defendants are pawns in several games .  abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause .  their lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees .  south carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states .  president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends .  when the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes .  even that doesn't work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims .  at the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners .  this little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america's past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court .  the slavery issue is easy pickin's for spielberg .  much like his " shindler's list " ( which followed " jurassic park " as this follows " lost world " ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose .  nazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human .  it's not hard to see who the bad guys are .  without that question to ponder , the director's job is more difficult .  he has to make the story interesting .  spielberg succeeds for the most part .  the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach .  where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle .  there are very few _people_ in the tale .  in fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out .  tappan and joadson are " abolitionists " : symbols but not humans .  van buren is a weak politician but nothing else .  the rest of the " slaves " barely exist other than dressing for the set .  like many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white .  the film's salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou .  the former model's first major role is a winner .  without speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog .  the other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in " nixon " ) .  the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen .  there are some other great moments .  especially impressive are the african's struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land .  their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant .  as grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans .  more humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film .

0 well , what are you going to expect ?  it's a movie about a big snake that eats people .  that's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more .  instead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too .  anaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river .  led by anthropologists dr . steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives .  along the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda .  to simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide .  if this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don't know what is .  at the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now .  i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing .  cale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help .  this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake .  however , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle .  most bad characters are either annoying or stupid .  in this movie , they're both .  since this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it's hard to find someone to root for .  you're supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else .  or maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else .  at times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake .  there are no standout performances here .  everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters .  even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason .  no matter , as in most monster movies , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway .  in most of the scenes , the snake is computer generated , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real .  however , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences .  sometimes , for example , the snake just moves too fast .  it catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall , for crying out loud .  then there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters , and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly .  absolutely ridiculous .  a testimony to the film's bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film , where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is .  in a scene totally unrelated to anything else , we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther .  the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard , one of the panther's eyeballs pops out .  eeeewwwww .  above and beyond the sick factor , however , this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed .  in films like these , a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained .  if the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see , we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them .  to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown .  in a case like that , the showdown just ends up being a letdown .  when i saw the snake for the first time , i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn't the real danger .  this one was just a decoy , and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe .  no such luck .  okay , maybe anaconda is actually a decoy , and there's really a better movie waiting to make its debut .  
1 buffalo ? 66 is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci .  gallo plays a very troubled man , who was sent to jail for gambling .  once out of jail , he must visit his parents , who he told he was married .  the truth is he isn't married .  to try to impress them , he kidnaps a girl ( christina ricci ) from a tap dancing class to act as his wife .  the film is very cheaply made , and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie , but you don't need money to make a good film .  buffalo ? 66 doesn't always stay with the realistic concept , and sometimes goes through outrageous events .  gallo's parents , played by angelica huston and ben gazarra , are two very strange individuals .  the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits .  gallo and ricci arrive at his parent's house , and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house .  ricci's performance during the scene at gallo's parent's home are very well done .  there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes .  the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative .  they seemed very mediocre , but they worked out just fine .  gallo's character is developed very well .  the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear .  gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through .  his character goes through many , many problems , just like many people in real life .  this character seemed very realistic to me .  ricci's character is funny and different .  she doesn't care much that she has been kidnaped , in fact , she falls in love the man who kidnaped her !  ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves .  buffalo ? 66 isn't all laughs though .  many scenes are very dramatic and depressing .  gallo's character was so realistic , he was extremely disturbing .  some scenes are supposed to come off as funny , but they actually seemed sad and real to life .  the film sometimes drags along , not giving much material .  i really would have liked to see gallo's parents a lot more , and i would have liked to see the characters developed more .  overall , buffalo ? 66 isn't as good as some people put it up to be .  the bottom line- a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom .  
0  " my name is jack carter , and you don't want to know me " says our brooding anti-hero ( sylvester stallone ) .  take his advice !  to know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace .  and to watch this film is almost as painful .   " get carter " is a gloomy looking , unimaginative film that offers no joy .  jack carter is as tough as tough guys come .  he works out of vegas as a self-described 'financial adjuster' .  explaining his duties , he says , " people make promises and break them .  i help them remember . "  he has a chiseled body full of tattoos .  he has the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times .  he speaks in a hushed but menacing tone of voice .  in other words , this is sylvester stallone acting like . . . sylvester  stallone .  and like most of his previous roles , his character is a shallow , one-dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough , hassle a few hapless people , find out what he needs to know , and then dispense his own kind of justice .  with the charisma of a pit bull , being tough is all that jack carter knows .  yet , even tough guys know when to put family first .  as the story begins , we learn that jack's little brother has died in a car accident .  the police attribute it to heavy drinking .  however , jack is suspicious , believing that he was 'taken out' .  he takes a break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth .  as he pokes around , he runs into several lowlife characters .  they include a shady business partner , a prostitute , a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates , and an oily owner of a porn website .  any one of them may know something about his brother's death .  all of them have the means of carrying out the deed .  but don't expect an exercise in sleuthing where well-placed clues lead carter to the truth .  he's all brawn and no brains , so there are no epiphanies during his investigation .  instead , he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward , cycling through this circle of suspects .  flustered with his lack of progress , he cycles through them again and again .  this all gets tiring fairly quickly .  by the time the film launches into its final act , we're numb from its pedestrian pace .  oddly , as a tough-guy thriller , it starves us for action .  admittedly , there is one nifty chase sequence , but this is related to a tangential and needless plot ( carter's vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him ) .  the story also fails to generate any kind of emotion .  stallone has the personality of a slab of stone .  and the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast .  the weather is constantly overcast or rainy .  meanwhile , most shots take place at night , in dimly lit rooms , or in dark alleys .  it's just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere .  as a result , " get carter " amounts to nothing more than a flat thriller , bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement .  you're better off leaving this guy alone .  
0 in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french-canadian co-production by max fischer .  the movie is set in paris where its hero , struggling american author david mirkine ( judd nelson , at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity ) suffers a terrible writers bloc .  he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle ( laurence treill ) .  unfortunately , she hangs out in jet set circles , which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous .  her connection with powerful david caravan ( pierce brosnan ) would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events .  although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller , drama would probably be more appropriate genre label .  pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers , and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments .  low budget also becomes painfully visible , and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film .  unfortunately , this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes , so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed .  instead , they would have to settle with pointless , slow scenes involving nelson , brosnan and laurence treill's attempts of serious acting .  all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone's precious time .  
1 it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of " the horse whisperer , " the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to " projection difficulties . "  robert redford's film version of nicholas evans' best-selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december , going head-to-head with " titanic , " but is only now making its much anticipated debut .  this ( strategic ? )  delay has allowed " the horse whisperer " to compete , sans fanfare , against some smaller , unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office .  no matter .  redford's film stands head and shoulders above james cameron's ocean-going tragedy , especially in the writing and acting departments .  whatever the reasons for its postponement , " the horse whisperer " supports the old adage " better late than never . "  redford has taken evans' book and given it the big screen treatment .  while parts of " the horse whisperer " are epic in scope and vision , especially the aerial " travelogue " that maps out this great country of ours , its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast .  when her daughter , grace , is involved in a terrible riding accident , hard-driven fashion editor annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace's beloved horse , pilgrim .  refusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down , annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faith-healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker ( redford ) , who has a way with horses and , perhaps , with people too .  undeterred by tom's initial reluctance to get involved , annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him , and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal .  redford's film unfolds slowly and lovingly , echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds .  the film's a little long and , even if you haven't read the book , it's pretty obvious where it's heading--but these are minor complaints .  redford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other , but it's scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role .  dianne wiest , chris cooper ( " lone star " ) , and sam neill--better than i've seen him before--round out the respectable supporting cast .  and the director's respect for horses is clearly in evidence .  one word of warning , however : while brilliantly shot , the accident scene , involving an out-of-control truck , is extremely disturbing .  redford's canvas is huge and exquisite .  he doesn't hesitate to incorporate vast , sprawling vistas of the american northwest : spectacular , snow-capped mountain ranges , azure skies , and shimmering fields of wheat--all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson's viewfinder .  veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity , since " the horse whisperer " is " dances with wolves " by way of " out of africa " ( oscar winners both for barry ) .  fortunately , barry's replacement , thomas newman , contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate , human conditions--sonorous , string-laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic , introspective movements ripe with nuance .   " the horse whisperer " is that rare kind of movie : it looks good , it feels good , and by golly it does you good .  the wait , it turns out , was well worth it .  
1 'pleasantville' ( 1998 ) taps into hollywood's lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed   ( www . pleasantville . com ) april 2 , 1999 ( friday )  cast : tobey maguire , reese witherspoon , william h . macy , joan allen , j . t .  walsh , jeff daniels  mpaa rating : pg-13 for sexual content and thematic elements  genre : drama  in my opinion :  in short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is .  review : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions .  the town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant .  there is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate .  put simply , it's a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for .  j one big note however is that it is only a 50's sitcom that airs in reruns on an " oldies " tv station ? or is it ?  i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed .  i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office .  but it wasn't until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy " dollar theaters " after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced .  it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some " healthy " immorality is not a world at all .  instead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn't give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right .  there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story .  now i'm not saying that's necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be .  besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch .  the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable .  after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it's hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more .  a truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork .  that said , the plot goes as such .  david and jennifer are two very 90's high school twins with the typical " relationship " outline of don't-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won't-mess-with-yours .  they demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today .  david is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation .  but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home .  nevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed .  and , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them .  not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place .  people got hurt .  they cried .  they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that's when their physical world turned colors as well .  this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear .  i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we'll never know what we could have done better .  until the next great movie i see , i remain sincerely , danielle flynn , imr  
0 can you say " dated " ?  you can if you've seen rosemary's baby which , like the exorcist , was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release .   " mystery science theater 3000 " has skewered the bad films of the past , but let me tell you , it could do a number on the " good " ones too .  rosemary's baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good-looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not-so-innocent husband ( john cassavettes ) , an actor who takes an easy , albeit evil , road to success .  it all seems so harmless in the beginning .  mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed .   ( there's also a skull in the living room , but it's only for decoration . )  their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming .  all's well for about the first hour of this slow-moving film , until mia eats some of the neighbors' chocolate mousse and passes out .  when she comes to , she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big , evil man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen .  it seems like a dream and , when she finds herself pregnant , she almost forgets about it .  and everyone's helping with the pregnancy .  the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink , a good-luck charm for her to wear around her neck , and the name of an obstetrician who's been in the business 66 . 6  years .  meanwhile , mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight .  before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries .  that's when you know your health's failing .  the only person in the movie who's the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend ( maurice evans ) who calls mia up to give her the bad news -- and immediately falls into a coma .  by about the two-hour mark i felt the same way .  rosemary's baby is way too long , and leads up to a payoff that's about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie .  i guess someone put a spell on this movie .  
1 is evil dead ii a bad movie ?  it's full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release .  explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult .  `well what's it about ? '  `five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly , hairy , wart covered monsters . '  `come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week .  why should i see it again ? '  `no evil dead ii is different , it's funny . '  `it's funny to see people die ?  are you sick or something ? '  maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie .  his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious .  an example of raimi's odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash's girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound .  sure it's over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet .  the whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster .  the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes .  no matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch bruce ampbell's ash get his butt kicked every five minutes .  and raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand .  like the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part .  but it doesn't end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family .  all of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny .  raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off .  with a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares .  ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn't wait to make it's sequel .  
0 i don't appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting , when in fact it's ludicrous .  in the case of the general's daughter , the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a certain point .  but at this juncture in the story , the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie .  this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving , and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it's detailed flaws .  get past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent , and you're likely to survive this entire movie .  travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner , who's working undercover at a military base when another situation arises : the apparent rape and murder of a young female officer ( leslie stefanson ) .  it turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) .  let the investigation begin .  with the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill ( played rather on-the-sidelines by madeleine stowe ) , brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case .  things begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore ( james woods ) , a former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve .  woods submits another scene-stealing performance here as he oozes authority , surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar .  with echoes of his supporting role in true crime , in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges , he makes every moment believable .  here though , the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta , as the two send mindful , knowing glares across the room .  there are many scenes such as this in the general's daughter , in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure , but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb .  director simon west ( con air ) , shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller , but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it .  the general's daughter is , more often than not , a predictable and unexciting mess .  it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless , dragging it's heels all the way at a mind-numbing snails pace .  a few brief action scenes , marvelously handled in the editing department , show that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package .  from a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts , i suggest west should stick with mindless , rip-roaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this .  still , the movie is certainly not without it's merits .  the acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast .  the performances range from commanding ( travolta ) to electric ( woods ) to stiff-as-a-board ( cromwell , who doesn't show off his real talents here ) .  madeleine stowe manages to hold her own for a while , but as the female lead in an action-thriller , she doesn't pull through sufficiently .  one of the problems with the execution is that it's very predictable .  >from minute one , i had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question .  the script even unwillingly points him out for us , using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end .  in all fairness , we've seen many of the devices used in the general's daughter put to greater effect in other films .  the secrets behind the girl's mysterious death are explained gradually , but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly .  the general's daughter is not a terrible movie , and it is involving enough to sustain a viewer's attention span for a certain period of time .  but it just could have been so much better .  
0 vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly d'angelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family .  as with the other three films , their two children , rusty and audrey , are played by a revolving series of actors .  this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles .  also back , is cousin eddie ( randy quaid ) , the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes .  in vegas vacation clark griswold ( chase ) decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen ( d'angelo ) can renew their wedding vows .  it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue .  apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldn't bother to write any jokes into the script .  at least that's the way it looks when watching this turkey .  about half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film , since there had been none up to that point .  by the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times , and i had smiled at a couple of gags .  i might add that none of the funny ( and i use the term loosely ) moments came as a result of anything chase , d'angelo or quaid were involved in .  they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film .  the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids , who manage to have a couple of their own adventures .  rusty becomes a vegas high roller , providing most of the film's best moments .  every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag , it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film .  which brings me to the best moment of the film .  the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road ( the theme from the original vacation ) begins to play .  christie brinkley and her red ferrari ( also from the first movie ) drive by .  it was a cute moment , but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been , and just how far that this series has fallen .  too bad .  
1  " remember what the mpaa says : horrific and deplorable violence is ok as long as you don't say any naughty words . "  featuring the voice talents of matt stone , trey parker , mary kay bergman .  rated r .  filmmakers jump on real-life controversies faster than austin powers on felicity shagwell .  the debate on whether cinema is to blame for teenagers turning into hoodlums has only begun to heat up , and already someone's made a movie about it , and it's not , thank god , a tragic account of a family ripped apart by the effect violence in films had on a teenage boy .  instead we get a sharp , biting satire that takes no prisoners and leaves no conservative point of view unscathed .  based on a popular ( and controversial ) cable tv show , south park : bigger longer and uncut can finally break loose of the shackles placed on the show by television restrictions and take bad taste to brand new heights .  the movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian r-rated movie and learn some naughty words .  when they exhibit their new knowledge to their moms , they decide to " blame canada , " wage war against the neighbor country and execute " terrence and phillip , " the flatulent actors in the obscene film .  the kids form an alliance they name " la resistance " ( with the accent on the third syllable of " resistance " ) to save their favorite thespians , in a hilarious spoof of ( tribute to ? )  les mis ? rables .  in a subplot , one of the characters ( kenny , who else ? )  dies and goes to hell where he meets satan .  satan and saddam hussein are lovers , you see .  satan is a benevolent soul , while our favorite eastern ruler can only think about sex .  apparently , too , if terrence and phillip are executed it will be the final sign of the apocalypse and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the underground kingdom to rule the earth .  aside from being a brilliant satire , south park is also an all-stops-out musical , with unforgettable numbers like " shut your f * * * ing face uncle f * * * er " and " cartman's mom is a big fat bitch " .  almost invariably it's funny stuff : often juvenile but always funny .  the same can be said for the rest of the movie : it's intelligent but delivered in a sophomoric manner ( i . e .  toilet humor , endless profanity , etc . ) .  not that there's anything wrong with that : vulgarity , when done right , is my bag , baby .  trey parker and matt stone , the twenty-somethings behind the film and the show , paint a bulls-eye on the motion picture association of america and proceed to be the first to start trying to hit it .  cruelly mocking the fact that the mpaa's rating system will allegedly tolerate grotesque violence as long as obscenities aren't uttered , the auteurs throw some nasty one-liner insults their way .  the ratings-a-plenty association isn't the only target of this unsparing banter : people who favor censoring movies over gun control are equally fair game , with the " blame canada " plot being a not-so-cheap shot at them .  the distinctively low-tech " cardboard " animation is oddly effective , even more so than the state of the art " deep canvas " technique aptly demonstrated in the recent tarzan .  it's more pleasant to look at , less intimidating up on the screen , and most importantly it doesn't detract from the film's concept as much as disney's admirably awe-inspiring work does .  the show's popularity has been waning as of late , and perhaps this movie is just the thing to boost its ratings .  perhaps not .  having seen the show on numerous occasions , i can say that it's not nearly as smart or as funny as this movie .  the series may be better off simply continuing on the big screen every couple years .  parker and stone have outdone themselves to the point where i am forced to ask : must the show go on ?   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  
0 janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker .  this is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs .  it also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too .  garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection .  denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that's made the kennedy family so popular .  so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit .  she soon learns why " easier said than done " is the mantra of movies like this .  the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can't get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on .  then comes what roger ebert calls the " meet cute . "  it happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way .  in the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side .  no points for guessing it's the same dog that just made water on her luggage .  also no points for guessing garofalo hates o'hara on sight .  that's how it works in movies like these .  i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she'd hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they'd reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits .  i haven't mentioned the movie's twist yet .  garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss .  milo o'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together .  rest assured he'll do all he can to match up garofalo and o'hara .  oh , and in keeping with the matchmaker's utter predictability , he dies toward the end .  what the message here ?  sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script .  i was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together .  leary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole .  he even undoes himself with the old microphone's still on after he's done giving the speech cliche .  both of them should have known better .  
0 saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night , and i have to say i wasn't too impressed .  this film is about an expert marine sniper , played by tom berenger , who is teamed with a hot-shot-young-no-experience-never-killed-a-man new partner to take out some drug-kingpins and military strong men in panama .  sound cliche ?  that's only the beginning .  billy zane ( memphis belle ) played the rookie , and never seemed to get a handle on his character .  he was so contrary and pig-headed in the beginning , you just wanted to smack him .  then he goes " crazy " from the pressure , but seems to immediately snap out of it .  i'm not sure if the blame should lie with the directing , editing , scriptwriting , or acting . . .  but it didn't all come together .  i think berenger is a pretty good actor , and he looked great in the part , covered in camo , face painted , stalking through the jungle with his high-power rifle . . .  but once again , his character was given some pretty bad dialogue , and didn't react too logically to many of the situations .  there was very little logical development in these characters .  my biggest problem with this film was it's tendency to put these two snipers in as * many * inches-from-death situations as possible .  they began to resemble g . i . joes , the greatest american hero .  and of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls .  now a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold , in fact that's what made die hard so much fun : the super-hero avenger type .  so some will enjoy the action hero heroics , but i didn't think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes , and the " real life " feel of covert operations in panama .  a word must be said on the camera work , much of it was very nice .  the jungles of panama ( or their stand-ins in this case ) formed a very picturesque background . . .  and the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography .  many have seen the slowed down " bullet-cam " following the projectile to its target .  this was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill .  it was dramatic when used in flashback . . . but  it seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots ( pardon the pun ) into the real time action . . . then  it just seemed silly .  all in all , not a real dog : there is some nice action , good atmosphere , and pretty photography .  but the plot is pretty lame , the acting didn't form a cohesive whole , and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics .  
0 movie concepts are often pitched to producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films of the past .  so , undoubtedly one day someone said , " 'evolution ? '  it's 'ghostbusters' plus 'men in black' plus 'tremors . ' "  and so it is .  sum total none .  the alienbusting begins when a meteor lands in glen canyon , arizona .  community college science profs ira kane ( david duchovny ) and harry block ( orlando jones ) take some samples from the meteor and discover that one-celled organisms from inside it are evolving rapidly , doing in hours what took millions of years for life on earth .  just about the time i was wondering , " hey , doesn't the government usually come in and take over the whole area in these movies , " the government came in and took over the whole area .  the leader of the pack , gen . woodman ( ted levine ) , turns out to be an old nemesis of ira's , and ira and harry are blocked from doing further research .  meanwhile , the organisms continue to grow until they are large enough to start attacking people .  by this time , ira and harry have gained a friend in dr . allison reed ( julianne moore ) of the center for disease control .  a country club poolboy , wayne green ( seann william scott ) , has also attached himself to the merry band .  but can they find the means to stop the aliens in time ?  director ivan reitman seems to be revisiting his biggest hit , 1984's " ghostbusters , " but " evolution " falls miserably short .  one reason is readily apparent .   " ghostbusters " had three really funny guys as its scientists ( bill murray , dan aykroyd , and harold ramis ) , but " evolution " has one really funny guy ( orlando jones ) who can adlib and milk the comic potential of lines that prove useless in anyone else's hands .  for good measure , " ghostbusters " had the comic talents of rick moranis ; " evolution " offers seann william scott , who was much funnier in " american pie " and " road trip " than he is here .  scott has one amusing scene where he sings " you are so beautiful to me " to a dragon-like alien to draw it into a trap .  other than that , scott seems unable to make much of the thin material the writers gave him .  an actor in search of a forte , david duchovny looked for his gritty action hero side in " playing god " and his romantic side in " return to me . "  now he wants to find his wacky comedic talent ; what we all find is that he doesn't have any .  look for him to be back on tv in five years or so .  another sad case is julianne moore , who needs to be more selective about the offers she accepts .  she's a talented actress with an impressive list of credits and award nominations , so why is she trying to do slapstick comedy ?  her character has a tendency to trip over and bump into things , but the trait comes off as a pathetic plea for laughs .  the sole saving grace of the film is jones .  he's at the center of the movie's funniest scene -- where an alien bug invades harry's body and has to be pulled out through his ass .  jones is the only cast member who can take the comedic ball and run with it , but he can't carry the whole movie by himself .  he found himself in a similar situation in " the replacements , " where he was also the only comic talent in an ensemble cast .  jones will eventually find the project that will make him a major comedy star , but this isn't it .  
1 a common complaint amongst film critics is " why aren't there more literate scripts available ? "  quiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isn't dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content .  paul attanasio's script takes what could have been a tepid thriller ( the quiz show scandals of the late 50s ) and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors .  the film is riddled with telling symbols ( e . g .  a '58 chrysler , a radio announcement of sputnik ) but is never heavy handed .  deft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes , john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script .  redford departs from the usually overlight , " cable tv quality " sets and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces .  quiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years .  although i was only 4 years old when the " twenty one " scandal broke , enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford's almost tangible palette .  from plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants , the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism , of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world war without " disposable income , " before the manifestation of its american dream .  the film deftly weaves several themes together , from assimilation and exclusion of jews from " the good life , " to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father's fame .  though the 50s audience that is " rocked " by this scandal may initially seem naive to us , they should appear all too familiar , with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding .  charles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day .  the tv audience is almost a fourth main character , always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf .  at the film's end , the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audience , mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff .  like the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret , this " mirror " may reflect an image we're not all that comfortable with .  
1 the event of events is upon us .  people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it .  i don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused .  it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history .  anyone who tells you " it's just a movie " is either lying or clueless .  it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic .  the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated .  but that does not mean that the film itself is bad .  in fact , it is terrific .  i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash .  it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place .  the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo .  the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as " the force " ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate .  unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene .  on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) .  he is an innocent slave boy , but " the force is strong with him " so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi .  as any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker .  >from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie .  around 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul .  i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this .  this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks .  he's essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like " exqueeze me ? "  and " mesa go now , okeday ? " , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying .  the visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph .  if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement .  the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn't already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term " popcorn movie " .  what made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams .  even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant .  his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling .  the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia .  when you see " a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away " , when the familiar music plays , when the words " star wars " appear on screen , you'll feel a tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77 .  it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side .  it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not .  we not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years .  the phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars .  it works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  
1 books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so .  this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre .  the special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later .  literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it .  and now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy .  much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr . lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now .  some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday's star wars updated with today's special effects wizardry .  either way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen .  can there be anyone in the world who doesn't know what star wars is about ?  in a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it .  it's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world .  it's high adventure , incredible special effects , and . . . well , it's just an _experience_ .  something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation . . . and  it's about to do so again .  this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now .  interviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm . . . all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www . islandnet . com/~corona/films/details/sw4 . html  or , my personal favorite , http : //leopard . cs . latrobe . edu . au/~koukoula/   ) .  pictures of before and after have been placed side by side . . . even  months before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons .  in some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater .  the digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original .  for instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings .  and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing .  all the starships and fighters are now computer-animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made--and they look _fantastic_ .  four and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn't do it justice .  however , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself .  the negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor .  the audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed , with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt , into glorious , booming , theater-shaking full-thx dolby digital stereo .  and _that_ , more than the added scenes or new special effects , is where the real value of this new version lies .  it's really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen .  even letterboxing doesn't make up for the decrease in size and definition .  in regard to the star wars special edition , and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released , i'll make this final recommendation : go and see it .  go and see it more than once . . . it  may be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it's gone this time .  take along the youngsters who've never had the big-screen star wars experience--you'll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time .  there's magic in this movie--special edition or no , there can be no denying that it's still star wars , and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages , from four to four hundred .  let's all return to that time long ago , and that galaxy far , far away . . .  
1 known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with " pretty woman , " which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone .  the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film's two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable .  the other winning element that makes " pretty woman " so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today's films as it is here .  edward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend's car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel .  stopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions .  agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor .  this meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he'd rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night .  just as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear .  the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers .  since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss .  allegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , " pretty woman " has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la " cinderella . "  the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been .  you honestly don't need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha .  the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner .  and yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , " pretty woman " is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers .  you'd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i've seen on film in the 1990's .  additionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts .  playing sex symbols throughout the '80s with such pictures as " american gigolo " and " an officer and a gentleman , " gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa .  julia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988's well-received " mistic pizza " and 1989's " steel magnolia , " for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence .  it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing .  after " pretty woman , " roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released " runaway bride , " which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder .  roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star .  an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances .  no only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path .  on the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel's lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty .  another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days .   " pretty woman " does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you'd expect , and wouldn't have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances .  this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem .  helped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian's best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie's overall fulfillment , " pretty woman " is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy .  
1 as the film opens up , expectant unwed mother sally ( played by drew barrymore ) encounters her baby's father in a fast food drive-through window .  after he gets his milkshake , he drives off , only to be pursued by a military helicopter .  from this moment forward , you know that this isn't going to be your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy .  home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian ( played by luke wilson ) , a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally . . . more  than he would care to admit ( hint : it has something to do with the father of sally's unborn child ) .  after taking a personal ( and professional ) interest in her , he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works , and the fun goes on from there .  this movie is a lot of fun .  it is comedic on two levels , as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy .  the romantic moments are sweet , yet not sappy .  one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes .  however , the dark comedic moments are more memorable .  this is also a tale of revenge , and a funny one at that .  the father of sally's unborn child also happened to be a married man , whose wife is played by catherine o'hara .  she does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair , and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work .   ( my apologies if this sounds cryptic , but there is too much of the plot to give away ) .  rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus , dorian's overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy , dorian's trainer at the fast food restaurant .  the dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones , even with the romantic nature of the plot .  if there are any complaints , it is over drew barrymore's performance .  while she does light up the screen , there are moments when she doesn't seem all that convincing .  the movie was filmed in texas , and most of the characters have southern texan accents .  drew barrymore's accent tends to come and go ( luke wilson doesn't seem to have this problem ) .  as well , she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant .  still , this movie is one that will please many viewers .  with plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments , this is sure to entertain .  
0 everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap , from the roger corman-grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign ( the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi : the undiscovered country ) .  but piller's not-quite-half-baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection's failure .  i'm about to give the same advice to rick berman and co .  as i've given to the financiers of james bond movies : it's time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and a real director .   ( while we're at it , put that visor back on laforge ! )  for three hundred years , the ba'ku species ( who look just like humans ) have lived on a ringed-planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth .  six hundred of them occupy the briar patch , the area affected by metaphasic radition , a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly .  but evil ru'afo ( this is probably abraham's last stop before performing " amadeus " at a dinner theatre near you ) , leader of the son'a ( who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery ) , wants to relocate the ba'ku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place , in order to replenish his dying breed .  the federation is all for this , but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive : to not interfere with the development of an alien race .   ( never mind that the ba'ku didn't exactly evolve-they went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world . )  every time frakes gives an interview lately , he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment .  he has called it a comedy , a thinking man's picture , a throwback to the old series , and , most grievously , he has likened it to a john ford western .   ( i presume that's some john ford he went to school with , not the director of the searchers . )  he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version .  that's no excuse-someone generated this footage .  muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems ; star trek : insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia .  consider such curiosities . . .  picard's love interest , anij ( donna murphy ) , can slow things down by staring at them ( such as a waterfall or falling rocks ) -her scientific explanation for this ?   " don't ask . "  worf gets a pimple ( he's re-experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the time-defying atmosphere ) , laforge regains his eyesight ( trust me , levar burton's real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact ) and troi brags about her firm boobs , but picard remains as bald as an android's butt .  most suspiciously , what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun ?  the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about a family feud of sorts , and they also turn ru'afo into a completely power-mad superfreak , just so the characters will have something to do in the climax .   ( and if you've seen return of the jedi , you've seen the ending of this movie . )  didn't picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions ?  frakes lucked out with first contact , and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection : he has no sense of comic timing , and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists .   ( take a look at the painful " troi gets drunk " scene in fc and you'll get the general idea of insurrection's unsuccessfully jokey and hollow tone . )  even the worst shatner and co .  treks , like the final frontier , maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless , charming comaraderie between kirk , spock , and bones .  neither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher ( gates mcfadden , whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique ) , troi , or laforge .  and all three next generation films spend too much time on data , who is the franchise's answer to urkel .  need a cheap laugh ?  have data say something sexual , or start singing , or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it's the hunk of styrofoam it really is .  here's my proposed title for number 10 : data star data trek : data data data data data .  in this movie , data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose , while crusher and troi watch silently from 500 yards away and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation .  star trek : insurrection had one nice , eerie , silent moment that hints at a better , darker film .  i'm not saying all of them should be star trek ii : the wrath of khan , but this one boldly went where no movie should go again .  
0 synopsis : a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend , who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night .  while this is going on , the thug , the father , the boyfriend , and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter .  comments : to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement .  i'm not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter .  suspense ?  family drama ?  humor ?  erotica ?  elements of each of these genres exist in the film , yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them .  instead , the babysitter is a dull , lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers .  i suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren't for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing .  alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer , the babysitter .  her character has absolutely no depth at all , and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters' fantasies .  everyone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends .  the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds .  the father ( played by j . t .  walsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband's best friend .  none of these fantasy sequences , trust me , are things that need to be seen , but we see them anyway , complete with cheesy , make-out saxophone music .  the thug , in the meantime , proves that he's evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason .  the most absurd character , however , is the babysitter's boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead .  the thug , in a manipulative , iago-like manner ( though he doesn't really need to try hard ) , manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking , smoking grass , running away from cops , and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes .  incredible !   ( of course , the boyfriend's original plan for the evening was , try not to laugh , to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j . d . salinger . )  if the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful , then it fails .  there are surprisingly few tense moments in this film , and nearly all of them come at the final minute .  by that time , however , the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them .  no suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception .  if the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous , then it also fails .  i found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed , at times , to be played for laughs .  if the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic , then , once again , it fails .  the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting .  finally , if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating ( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning ) , then it fails as well .  the dream sequences aren't erotic ; they are too brief and , outside of one very short scene , contain no nudity .  i can't completely trash this movie .  the first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film , and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight .  the other 79 minutes , though , are a drag .  silverstone's character , at the end of the movie , turns to her boyfriend and asks " what were you thinking ? "  i asked myself the same question , having spent 99 cents renting this turkey .  
1 in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers .  full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture .  go see it !  so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on " hard copy " with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's .   " hard copy " 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for .  smart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal .   ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . )  smart's got a point .  it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version .  however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later .  real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman .  to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb .  the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv . '  of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon .  but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily .  kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne .  i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture .  her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates .  kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell .  she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way .  at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law .   " you know , " she knowingly exclaims , " gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . "  her husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters .  this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks .  the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix .  he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors .  kidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland .  phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) .  his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever .  phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him .  gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate .  he keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along .  van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions .  van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story .  the screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i've heard since heathers .  henry's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters .  henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic .  danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands .  either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties .  all-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks !  to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant .  written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard .  rated r - for language and mature themes .

0 the yet-to-be-released krippendorf's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but buyer beware .  this movie can't make up its mind .  is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies , menstruation , circumcision , and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them ?  or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort ?  either way , " unbalanced " is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort .  the premise is catchy - widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) has spent the past two years " getting over " the death of his wife , neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses .  now it's time to show what he's achieved in those two years , and he has absolutely nothing to show for it .  with a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea , krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous $100 , 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonald's .  but when his " discovery " becomes the latest craze among colleagues , the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe - he must create it .  with the aid of his three children , the headstrong teen shelly ( natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you ) , the slightly younger mickey ( gregory smith ) , and the nine-year-old edmund ( carl michael lindner ) , the " shelmikedmu " tribe ( named from the first half of each child's name ) is born , and videos quickly produced in krippendorf's backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe .  despite the professor's wishes , the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows , due in greatest part to veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , an overly vivacious ( and voluptuous ) anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorf's main assistant .  hungry for recognition , micelli sets up interviews , lectures , etc . in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history , a sure fire way to go down in the history books .  krippendorf , on the other hand , is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor , not in history books , and with each new lecture , he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe - mating habits , domestic structure , etc . thru fumbling improvisation , and often some quick thinking from his oldest son , krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture , but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe .  on the opposing end is krippendorf's arch rival , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) , an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non-existent tribe .  it's a cute idea , and approached with a more subtle ( and mature ) style , krippendorf's tribe could've been a real winner .  sadly , the mostly-misfired toilet humor , overly comical musical score ( by bruce broughton ) , and sugar coated sentiments ( all the key ingredients of a " family comedy " ) just aren't the right tone for this film .  cut that crap out , add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and you've got a good start .  at the state it's in now , you've got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs .  doubtfire meets dumb & dumber , and that's not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try .  the overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of " average " , with a few laugh-out-loud moments and a great big gap in between them .  most of the characters are surprisingly two-dimensional , and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort ( lyonne ) seems to go greatly unappreciated .  director todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways .  it's stuck in limbo between disney family fare ( jungle 2 jungle ) and potentially hilarious adult comedy ( a fish called wanda ) .  it's this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade , and it's a brutal drop .  a strong warning to parents : forget the impression given by advertisements , do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because she's holding his penis ?  yes , it's put that bluntly !  just be warned - this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film , and others might not be as tame .  
0 a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature , beams itself onto a russian science vessel .  well , this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller .  anyhow , this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus' known as man .  the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated , and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it .  no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies , the movie is that predictable .  the story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist .  the captain of the tug , played by donald sutherland , makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age ( looks to be in his 60's ) .  to add to this we're shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields , and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks .  some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific , in a typhoon no less .  none of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control .  this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story , a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable .  all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects .  the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves .  it looks genuinely fake , granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish .  also on the topic of flaws , the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly , why ?  if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics , should it not be able to create them move faster ?  regardless , the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it .  as to the actual casting for the movie , finally there is nothing to complain about .  the actors were superb , but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles .  having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe .  watching these actors act this story out made it bearable , if barely .  the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening .  so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci-fi thriller then you won't be too disappointed .  as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens , it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect .  this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv .  
0 well lets see . . . i'm  not quite sure how to review this film , based on its laughter factor .  well yeah i can , it's not funny .  ok so i laughed one time which warranted the 1/2 star , but other than that i sat in my seat wondering when this pos would be over , ( which at a running time of 107 minutes seemed like forever ! ) .  in fact , this could be the un-funniest movie i've seen in a long time , if not the un-funniest .  let me be the first to say " ready to rumble " is a huge disappointment .  long time wrestling lovers ( david and scott ) dream of making it to the wcw , and watching jimmy king wrestle .  that is their hero of course , whom is kicked out of the wcw .  well here is where the plot thickens ( lol ) : the two wish to rescue the king , and put him back into the wcw but not that easily , because they are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them , while david's father wants him to become a police officer , and scott is a loser who has to with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots .  what a plot eh ?   " ready to rumble " is one of those films that tries to be funny , but sadly fails miserably , everything in the film is imcomprehinsable , and even the trailer wasn't funny .  the actors are dull , the script awful , and the plot which there isn't much of . . . . really  annoying .  i'm not quite sure how great actors like these , and very funny actors too , are given such a lame script , and directed in such a childish manner , that i wonder if hollywood is ever gonna make good films these days .  this review isn't going to be very long because of the fact that there isn't much going for the film , if anything at all .  only one big laugh is in the film , which isn't all that hilarious .  i sat in my chair wondering with this 107 ( ! ! ! ! ! )  minute " comedy " was going to be over , and sadly it went on forever .  i'm not sure if anything could have saved this film from being such a total waste , but believe me you , it is .  reviewed by brandon herring 4/29/00 for more reviews please visit movie review central at http : //www . geocities . com/moviefan983/moviereviewcentral . html  
0 talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters !  spice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls .  it's intended as a sort of hard day's night , but ends up simply hard to watch .  when watching the spice girls , i'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name .  the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented .  there's ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you're almost certain the post sticks out her throat .  the film itself doesn't really have a plot .  it follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their " first live performance " at albert hall .  the action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas .  the various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even  when they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff .  whew .  for some reason , the film is littered with star cameos .  from elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf .  heck , even roger moore shows up , though he can't decide if he's parodying himself as james bond , or if he's lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld .  richard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band's manager , clifford .  the celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film .  neither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring .  their songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos .  my advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either  option will be more enjoyable than the film .  non-fans should know to stay well away from this one .  
0 susan granger's review of " glitter " ( 20th century-fox )  there's less here than meets the eye .  or , put it this way , if you thought madonna was awful in " shanghai surprise , " mariah carey's worse in this reworking of " a star is born . "  she plays billie frank who , despite being abandoned by her singer/alcoholic mother ( valerie pettiford ) , believes she's destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is .   " you've got this amazing gift , and you gotta use it , " her roommate says .   " your voice - it's incredible , " says another singer .   " i ain't never met anyone like you , " proclaims julian " dice " black ( max beesley ) , the hot new york dj who becomes her svengali-like producer/lover .  problem is : her signature song , " i didn't mean to turn you on " is wretched .  and when she fumes out of filming her first music video because the director wants to " exploit " her by having her wear a bikini , the audience bursts into laughter .  exploit mariah carey , who chooses to wear as little as the law will allow ?  come on !  writer kate lanier's script is fatuous and director vondie curtis-hall doesn't have a clue how to handle the glitzy pop diva and , as a result of their incompetence , whispery-voice'd ms . carey seems to be embarrassed on-screen .  she almost cringes when the camera comes in for a close-up , pursing her lips and averting her glassy eyes .  talented british musician max beesley appears equally inept , and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans around the manhattan skyline , there's an audible audience groan when the twin towers of the world trade center come into view .  perhaps one of the reasons ms . carey suffered her highly-publicized nervous breakdown this summer is because she saw a preview of this clunker .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " glitter " is a pathetic 1 .  right now , it's tops on my list of the worst of 2001 .  
0 once upon a time jean-claude van damme was a decent action hero .  the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films , boasting his spectacular martial-arts ability .  some of these excursions were fun .  but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore , with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind-numbing action .  and when the action goes sour , what is there left to enjoy ?  i'll explain .  knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong .  marcus ray ( van damme ) , a babe-magnet and stylish dresser , heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner ( rob schneider ) .  they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans , seemingly by a mole in the business .  i'm going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph , so if you want a review devoid of spoilers , skip onto the next one .  i'm not quite sure who gives a crap , but i'll issue a warning anyhow .  tommy is really working with the cia .  his boss ( a very hammy and flat paul sorvino ) is the mole , and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons .  he even stoops so low to put them into children's toys .  if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing , then you probably will enjoy knock off .  if you think that this ridiculous set-up couldn't even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing , this might not be your cup of tea .  knock off sucks .  it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares .  it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something , simply because van damme is the star .  the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind , the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe , and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe .  director tsui hark ( who teamed with van damme in the superior , but still lame-brained double team ) is at the helm , and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot .  i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work , but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous .  the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence , speeds are altered consistently , and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired .  it all sounds very cool .  trust me , it isn't .  as much as it scars me to say this ( har , har ) , van damme is terrible .  sure , he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease .  he looks like he's doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan , and his performance is stiff and tired .  i hate to say it , but perhaps it's time for mr . van damme to give up his day job .  it's really a test of endurance watching knock off .  i suppose there's some enjoyment derived from schneider's character , who is extremely annoying , but provides the film's better moments .  and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie ?  hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter .  knock off doesn't even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film , like a handful of van damme's others .  no , this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking .  and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department , that is certainly not saying much .  note to self : avoid universal soldier 2 : the return upon release in august ? 99 .  
0 8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery .  nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs . christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe .  the movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie' , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed .  all mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not .  welles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide .  although the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most .  the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away .  8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you haven't seen from another standard thriller .  the cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage .  while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998 . )  here , in 8mm , he's boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice .  and in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up .  only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent .  his performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he's just purely enjoyable to watch .  catherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves .  her character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year .  also fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director .  as this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch .  unlike seven , 8mm isn't too clever , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives .  lacking the strong characters seven featured , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment .  but director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it's just not very disturbing .  schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience , and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly' of the porn industry , it doesn't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point .  also , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed , so cliched , it's amazing to think it's the same film you're watching .  8mm is far from an success , a 'snuffed' opportunity .  with a boring lead character , 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller .  ultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like .  and trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it .  
1 capsule : the best place to start if you're a jackie chan newcomer .  roars along , never stops for breath , and frequently hilarious .  to talk about jackie chan as a " stuntman " is to miss a million things .  jackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today , but also a very funny guy .  he reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger * used * to make me laugh -- he's funny just standing there , copping a look .  supercop has jackie making us laugh , scream , duck , root , and gasp for breath , often all in the same scene .  it's actually the third in a loosely related series of movies , each with jackie playing kevin chan , a hong kong policeman who has a knack for getting neck-deep into trouble and then karate-kicking his way out of it .   ( the others are also worth seeing . )  it's a little slow to start , but once it gets moving , it's a field day .  the movie has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind .  kevin is tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china , which requires him to collaborate with the attractive ( and ass-kicking ) chief fo chinese security ( played here by the ever-enjoyable michelle yeoh ) .  there's a fun chemistry between the two of them , especially in an early scene where she tries to brief him and he keeps making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform .  kevin is assigned to help spring a known gangster from jail -- all undercover , of course -- and have him lead the two of them to a noted drug boss .  the drug boss , however , has problems of his own : his wife's on trial for many of his own crimes , and she's got the key to an account with all of his drug funds .  this means , of course , endless trouble -- not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while he's out in the field , and she sees him with this other woman , and . . . but that's one of the movie's unique pleasures : the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly .  action . there is , of course , non-stop action in this movie -- everything from one-on-one kung fu to all-out gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines ( ! )  outrunning the hong kong coast guard .  there is also a virtuoso climax , which features , among other things , jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter , a wrong-way freeway chase ( which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt ) , a fight on top of a moving train that also involves the 'copter as well as a motorcycle .  you get the idea .  this is to action movies what a burger with everything on it is to fast food : quick , enjoyable , filling .  watch it with friends .  when they stop making movies like this , the world will be a tad greyer .  
0 it's a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise .  the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying .  osmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there's something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt .  not that there's anything wrong with scatology .  i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was .  it's merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable .  you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn .  osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho .  the trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen-age audience may find it too tame for their tastes .  adults ? well , let's just say most will find it unappetizing .  osmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby .  the live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe .  he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower .  frank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast-food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you .  he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does .  frank's body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard-boiled egg that had fallen to the ground .  it's not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth .  nope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate's mouth .  like i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one .  after ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences .  here , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier's david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) .  basically , what we have is a cliched cop-buddy movie , rife with all the clich ? s of that genre .  and this is why osmosis jones doesn't click .  it merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations .  the jokes and puns are lame : osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus .  after pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , " funny , he doesn't look fluish . "  and the jokes don't rise above that level .  the live action scenes are no better .  frank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child .  he's almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters .  osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left .  the animation is rather two-dimensional and flat .  it lacks scope and depth .  it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head , and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater .  
1 it's rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year , but that is what disney and pixar animation ; s latest film represents .  while a bugs life isn't nearly as deep as it's predecessor , dreamwork's antz , it is just as funny .  a bug's life centers , appropriately , around the life of an ant , named flik .  flik , cutely voiced by newsradio's david foley , hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task .  when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost , the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way .  the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them .  the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper , who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey .  when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food .  when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission , they never dream he will be successful , they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food .  flik's mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return .  instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs , who he mistakenly assumes are warriors .  when he returns with the `warriors' , the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes .  a bug's life has animation that is simply stunning .  the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative .  together with the great voice acting , this film is the perfect holiday family film .  its main weakness is that it couldn't beat antz to the theaters , making it seem like stale material .  
0 for a good ten years or so , super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene .  now , he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo , ( who launched chow's super stardom in the acclaimed 'a better tomorrow' ) by moving to hollywood .  i had some reservations about this move and it would seem i was right to have them .  chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt .  his final job requires him to kill a policeman's seven year old boy .  this he refuses do and runs .  however , he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job .  cue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot- outs which take place in various locations .  some thought had gone into making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring .  the car wash scene , i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked .  tut tut .  the emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music , ( i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie ) and not on the content .  mia sorvino ( a passport forger ) is dragged into the affay and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a gun .  director antoine arqua has clearly not observed chow's excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots .  chow's trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale ( which in fairness is quite good ) and there's not even a toothpick in site .  and as for making chow shoot like a cop , well that's damned unforgiveable .  to round up , the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for chow .  it would appear he has left asia for a 90 minute pop video .  this is not what we wanted at all , considering john woo was the exec producer .   ( did he have no say so at all ? )  watch 'the killer' again and weep at the difference .  review by chris hill .   " there's room at the top , they are telling you still , but first you must learn how to smile as you kill , if you want to be like the folks on the hill . "  
0 for his directoral debut , gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent , alcoholic husband and father , and the various lives he affects .  but while the characters , places and events may have special meaning to the writer-director , the audience is left in the dark .  the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ( ray winstone ) , and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him .  he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars .  then , he returns home to his pregnant wife , valerie ( kathy burke ) and their five-year-old daughter .  raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies ( and his paranoid delusions ) early on when he accuses valerie's brother , billy ( charlie creed-miles ) , of stealing .  raymond then proceed to beat ( and bite ) him to a bloody wreck .  but these are the least of billy's problems .  billy is a heroin addict on the downturn , and it doesn't seem that he'll last much longer .  billy and valerie's mother , janet ( laila morse ) , is raymond's nemesis .  she disapproves of him ( and he of her ) , but is powerless to do anything about it .  she merely struggles on , hoping her children will survive their respective torments .  if this description seems bleak , i haven't told the half of it .  this is not a cheery movie , and most of the time it's downright depressing .  while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick , and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him , in the end , it's not quite worth it .  there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose .  take for example the extended sequence where one of billy's scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy .  the film is filled with these " character moments " that never really achieve anything .  granted , there are a few genuinely powerful ( and sickening ) moments in the film , but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us .  the actors do a fine job , particularly in the central roles .  the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes , and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into .  the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there's no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices .  a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience .  oldman got it about half right .  
1 films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before .  for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .  to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .  the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .  in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes .  getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?  the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end .  it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called " unfortunates " ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .  when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .  abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium .  upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach .  i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .  in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .  it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .  and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( " who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? " ) .  don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it .  now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .  the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic .  oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .  even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent .  ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham .  i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad .  the film , however , is all good .  2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content  
0 be warned . .  brit love story in the offing .  effeminate , mild-mannered karl is about to take a beatng from a bunch of ruffians at school as he bathes himself under a shower , his genitals tucked between his legs in the manner of a posing transvestite .  he is only just saved by prentice , who appears in all respects barring his protective attitude towards karl to be your average street-wise punk-in-the-making .  the ensuing scene ends up with both boys being ridiculed and then unfairly expelled from the school .  they do not see each other for another eighteen yeas .  in that time , prentice has matured into a somewhat loveable , if brash and bull-heaed goon who screws up his jobs and relationships while gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets , motorcycles and punk rock music .  karl , on the other hand , has grown up to become kim , a drabby , insecure woman who works as a verse writer for a greeting card company .  chance brings the two together , and love , such as will inevitably blossom in your quirky british romantic comedy , is what this skewed little story is largely about .  if at this point you think you're going to get any cheap laughs with that gender-bending theme ( see the birdcage , to wong foo . . . , priscilla queen of the desert ) , you can just go home and brood on your own maladjusted sexuality you low-life deadbeat .  kim is a post-operative transsexual , thank you very much . . .  a new-born woman for all purposes , with confusions and sensitivities that deserve treatment with a touch of delicacy .  personally , give me those cheap laughs any day .  i'd rather enjoy obvious camp than endure the shallow exploration of a soft- hearted transsexual love story .  different for girls comes up with a promising enough proposition , but does nothing that surpasses the merely workmanlike with it .  by refusing to make the audience really uncomfortable with the notion of kim and prentice's relation- ship , or at the very least feel uncomfortable for them ( prentice for example , doesn't seem to give hiself all that much grief when he becomes attracted to kim despite being a fight-picking , beer-drinking , macho kind of guy , and kim , for all her insecurities and fears is always saved any truly disturbing victimisation in the film ) , and instead drawing them into a basically wimpy love story , the film manages to lobotomise itself .  lightweight comedy as it's doomed to be , it could've still have hacked it with the requisitive endearing couple .  but this doesn't either , since even mrs doubtfire is sexier than steven mackintosh's kim foyle , and as either sex , he's just plainly a simpering wanker nobody should like .  prentice does though , and that's never explained .  but then rupert graves gives us so heroic performance as prentice , the guy who never grew up ( and if there is a bafta prize for most convincing portrayal of a rabid fan at a buzzcocks' concert , he should win that too ) that i guess there's no reason to explain why he's so screwed up .  if oddly enough you grow to like this show , you'll be wanting your happy ending , and the film won't fail you there either .  snide underling at kim's office gets her come-uppance .  misogynistic police officer who beats up prentice gets his come-uppance .  the couple prevail against a disagreeable society and come together in kim's apartment .  kim's sister and her impotent sarge-type husband kiss and make up after a tiff ( tv movie sub-plot with incidental juxtaposition ) .  and best of all , kim sheds her insecurities and learns how to ride the motorcycle and wear leathers , making prentice ride pilion .  awwww .  terrific closure .  happy ending .  but just what is it that's differnt for girls anyway ?  if you figure that one out , let me know .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  
0 i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie .  using their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget .  this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) .  now , before i continue to ferociously attack what's wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller .  catherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) .  if you've ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don't have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes .  the problem we come to is that we've all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn't break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre .  the result is that the entire production feels contrived .  i'm going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones .  now while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn't for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are .  just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between " entrapment " and " blackmail " .  with an eighty million dollar budget , you'd think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x .  well , you'd be wrong .  the action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular .  unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years .  the reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what's going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists .  many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing .  one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask .  nothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn't she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ?  i'll tell you why : because it's a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) .  ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) .  one last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he'll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion .  i can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself " it'll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ?

1 there must be some unwritten rule that states , one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom , even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere .  in the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year's stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech .  at least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers .  she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in .  drugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the 'good life' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there .  but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here .  in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken .  even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from .  the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud's grand-daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister .  it is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie .  the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls .  with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) .  he becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls .  the girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don't know what to make of the relationship .  it especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home .  things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village .  it seems only that bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there .  this scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also .  but i doubt that .  the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel .  lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a 'normal' girl .  the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets .  kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose .  the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film .  the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves .  the family's travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her .  that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts .  it will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence .  he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him .  the new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn't comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god .  the film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia .  the storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by .  her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best .  she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey .  after all , the mystical trip is the journey .  the film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings .  bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity .  the little girls are precocious but they are lovable .  julia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them .  she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she's at .  this is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being .  and , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was !  
1 in my review of there's something about mary , i said something to the effect of " laughter isn't everything . "  i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate : laughter isn't everything , unless i'm watching a jim abrahams film .  see , spoofs are easy with me .  i love movies , and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love .  sometimes i'm the only one in the theater laughing .  sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high-pitched in comparison to my speaking voice ( it cuts right through everyone else's laughter ) .  sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film .  abraham's latest film , mafia ! , induced this kind of hysteria upon me .  it's gotten some mediocre reviews , but , hey , i'm the guy who laughs at everything .  there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film , but there are far more that work , and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness .  i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought-provoking .  most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things , like develop characters , shape stories , and other such nonsense .  mafia !  has no pretentions about characters or story , and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh .  the film begins on the perfect high note , with a mockery of the opening of casino .  our hero ( jay mohr ) is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car , which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire .  to describe the story of mafia !  is absurd and pointless , but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films , with a lot of casino references inserted throughout .  along the way , the parodies seem arbitrary , and rarely victimize mob films : pictures like the english patient , forrest gump , and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing .  movies like this rely on just a few things , but the most important element is direction .  abrahams has been down this path many times before ( hot shots ! , top secret ! , airplane ! , and any other film with an exclamation point in the title ) , and so i hold most of the success of mafia !  to his experience .  he takes just the right attitude in each scene , and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references ( one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic , but it never develops ) .  the actors are all energetic , which helps a lot with the tone of the film .  mohr ( suicide kings , paulie ) , who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors , is so good here .  he looks like he's having so much fun that he's containing his laughter in every scene ( watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool ) .  he's probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material .  lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando's godfather , while pamela gidley is dead-on in a full-blown mockery of sharon stone .  the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i'm supposed to give examples of things and be specific .  unfortunately , i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia !  that i can't remember a lot of what made me laugh .  but that's a good sign : mafia !  is so funny that i wasn't even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory .  i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain .  i know that doesn't sound particularly complimentary , but when watching a dumb comedy like this , the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain .  finally , a film that does this for me .  
1 when i saw the trailer for " the sixth sense , " i didn't expect much from it .  my snap judgment was that it was a watered-down version of " the shining " or possibly a late-entry in the glut of angel-related movies/tv shows of a couple years ago .  but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot .  it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year .  bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe .  at the beginning of the movie , he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work , but he is soon confronted by vincent , a patient malcolm failed years earlier ( donnie wahlberg-former new kid-in an impressive cameo ) .  a year passes , and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed .  cole sear ( haley joel osment ) is a withdrawn kid who is called " freak " by the other boys in the neighborhood .  weird things seem to happen around cole-his mother ( olivia williams ) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn't moved-and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn't-for example , that there was once a gallows in his school .  he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom .  the trailer gave away the movie's first major plot twist .  if it hadn't , the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn't know what's wrong with cole .  if you're lucky enough to have not seen the trailer , stop reading this review right now and go see " the sixth sense . "  anyway , since the trailer gave it away , i figure it's fair game to discuss here .  once malcolm gains cole's trust , cole reveals his secret : he sees ghosts everywhere .  dead people wander around not knowing that they're dead , invisible to everyone except cole .  malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth .  the box office success of " the sixth sense " has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that's so .  i hate to burst anybody's bubble , but " the sixth sense " isn't really a horror film .  at its core , " the sixth sense " is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally-scarred adult help each other to move past their problems .  some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy , though .  one that really got to me : the ghost of a boy says to cole , " i'll show you where my dad keeps his gun " ; when the ghost turns , we see the bullet wound in the back of his head .  osment gives the best performance i've ever seen from a child actor .  it's hard enough to find a grown-up in hollywood who can give a subtle , realistic portrayal !  although willis gets top billing , cole is really the protagonist of the story , and osment truly brings the complex kid to life .  if only willis' work were as impressive .  accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue , willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm , his most challenging role to date .   ( this is a bad omen for his next movie , " the story of us , " which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage ) .  writer/director m . night shyamalan has a light , poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite .  he's also a skillful storyteller , as the movie's ending demonstrates .  only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie .  look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole .  bottom line : osment should get an oscar nomination , and you should go see this movie .  
0 synopsis : original " jurassic park " survivor alan grant ( neill ) is tricked by paul and amanda kirby ( macy and leoni ) into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur , to rescue their stranded son .  grant's team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar , and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought .  review : there is one reason why " jurassic park iii " is better than its immediate predecessor , " the lost world : jurassic park " .  the latter wasted 129 minutes of my life ; the former , only 94 .  the first " park " was a marvellous film , full of awe-inspiring sights , interesting characters , and genuine thrills .  its two successors have been pale imitations , amounting to hundred-million-dollar b-grade horror movies .  at least this third entry realises it ; whereas " the lost world " tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot , " jurassic park iii " simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin .  there is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie ; the computer-animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting , and even the first-time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation .  remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie ?  nothing in this rehash even comes close .  add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman , payne and taylor , and phoned-in performances by the normally capable macy and leoni , and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts .  at least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity of his character , and there is much less gore than in " the lost world " , making this installment more suitable for children .  
1 sam ( matthew broderick ) is an astronomer in a small american town and engaged to teacher linda ( kelly preston ) .  he is head over heels in love and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton ( tch ? ky karyo ) comes as a complete surprise to him .  but as we all know love is blind and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her back .  he moves into an abandoned house across the street from anton's apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch them .  suddenly anton's ex maggie shows up , but she does not want her former lover back .  on the contrary , all she wants to do is vaporize him .  she may say that she doesn't want to kill him , but the possibility doesn't bother her too much either .  after all , people die every day .  in spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on .  the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times .  but we haven't .  griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since " while you where sleeping " .  the camera obscura adds a " special something " to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy .  everything about the movie is perfect , from set design to casting .  the dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite .  meg ryan , known from " when harry met sally " or " sleepless in seattle " , surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image .  she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl .  even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her , much more so than in last years " courage under fire " where she played a gulf war pilot .  matthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality .  the viewer can tell that he doesn't only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them .  he has trouble keeping in touch with reality .  after all , who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love ?  his naivet ? that we don't question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge .  she would do anything to harm anton .  she doesn't hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them .  that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed , have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier .  tch ? ky karyo is perfect as anton .  he is , well , repulsive .  that's all there is to say about him .  you can't really manage to pity him , even after all his mishaps .  he not only took sam's bride away from him , he is also a french chef .  worlds collide , i .  e .  the usa and france .  this can only go wrong .  even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking , you just can't sympathize with a man who plays " je t'aime . . . moi  non plus " on his tape deck .  not everyone is captured by the french charme that linda and even maggie fell for .  sam certainly isn't .  too bad for anton .  for him things take a turn to the worse .   " addicted to love " is one of this year's most pleasant surprises .  
1 i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool .  i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement .  this was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm .  then marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups .  it certainly didn't look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his " last night of freedom . "  ben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this 'till death do you part business .  then , on an ill-fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah , ben meets sarah lewis ( sandra bullock ) , a free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her .  as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he's never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she's never had .  forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue .  ben is an ideal role for affleck's easy-going charm , and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation .  sandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping .  the two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script's apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely .  lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification .  the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution .  forces of nature isn't about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it's about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it's not what he thought it was .  lawrence's script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense .  earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine .  though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you'll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom .  that is , provided you're not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes .  for a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans .  occasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can't find what's underneath .  a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes' excesses can't spoil this unique concoction .  forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents .  
0 at first glance , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise .  its plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell , desiring to take over the world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power .  he attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon's parents .  given a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying father , talon vows for revenge .  eleven years later , when he's established his own army , the mercaneries , he vows to take back his kingdom .  along the way , he meets up with alana , whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell .  talon vows to help , and , after a series of minor escapades , eventually ends up rescuing alana's brother ( and several other prisoners ) , only to be captured himself ( in other words , put on a cross to be crucified ! ) .  fortunately he frees himself , rescues alana from marrying cromwell , defeats xusia , and then cromwell , all with his triple bladed sword ( during the final battle , the blade breaks , but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade ) .  then , everything ends happily .  unfortunately , the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds .  what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping , bad acting , and gruesomely gory , bloody scenes .  never once does the story seem to connect together , it just jumps around repeatedly .  this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia .  after telling him that he needs his help , he leads the warlock out into daylight , but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards .  wait a minute , didn't the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh-dan , which he cannot do by military force ?  if that is the case , why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him ?  and why does he manage to take over eh-dan anyway ?  these questions are just never - no , never - answered in the film .  another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life , another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana's wedding to cromwell ( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with alana , he just tells her to " wait " , and then he just rides off !  in addition to the extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure .  even some attempts to make it exciting , a few fire scenes , battle scenes , don't work .  it just completely fails altogether miserably .  the only good thing about this film is its musical score , contributed by david whittaker , who had an ( extremely ) short music composing career .  the score is boomy and adventurous , powerful , and a billion times better than this film is .  my suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) .  ironically , though , before the film's credits roll , there is a message indicating that a sequel , tales of the ancient empire , would follow .  to my relief ( and delight ) , it never got into production , because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office , grossing only $39 million .  critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer , all right .  leonard maltin rightfully called it " second rate in scripting , and acting " and at-a-glance film reviews called it " a confusing , stupid , unimaginative , unengaging , bloodfilled bore " .  i totally agree with these reviews , all right , and i hope that this piece of #$% !  will be forgotten about .  there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer .  i hope you get a good laugh out of this review , but i am not laughing .  in fact , my insults don't even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time .  
1 seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) .  one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise .  with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie .  there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there .  the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict .  the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist .  we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely .  later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right .  the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling .  this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone .  the man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him .  in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while .  but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story .  eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police .  we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time .  two other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies .  it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film .  he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story .  but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo .  everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities .  however , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential .  by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax .  everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction .  but , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . '  for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) .  the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight .  at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then .  this premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard .  he does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form .  the aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not .  in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world .  however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is .  the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) .  for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending .  and that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense .  ironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world .  with `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message .  still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable .  there's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does .  the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years .  `dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world .  
1 plot : a group of asbestos cleaners get a job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum .  as each day passes , the crew members begin to discover things about the place and themselves which set other things in motion .  saying anything else about the plot would be a crime .  have fun . . .  critique : " i feel like shooting myself in the head " are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie , a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here .  this ain't your average " happy go lucky " kind of picture .  this is a deliberately slow-paced mystery-horror film drenched in atmosphere , with a very creepy insane asylum ( in which most of the film takes place ) , very few clues up-front and lots to talk about afterwards .  will it bore some people to sleep ?  you bet it will !  is it made for the scream audiences of the day ?  absolutely not !  i guess you can describe this film as a horror movie for the " cerebral crowd " .  a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame , giving away very little with each step and each sound , unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later .  i've always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this film fits right into that group .  in fact , i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a " mindfuck " .  if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly , gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds , tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together , well , then this movie is definitely for you !  it's the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate ( damn , i missed that whole " peanut butter " thing ! ) and one that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark .   " brrrrrrrrr . . . now  what was that sound in the basement ?  honey , can you go check ? "  and one thing this film doesn't have , unlike its hollywood-ian counterparts like the haunting , is special effects .  in fact , that's one of the greater things about this movie : it feels real because it looks like it's actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances ( i did some research and it was , in fact , shot on digital video . . . ah-ha ! ) .  another great thing about it is that it's actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme , and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen ( it's mostly implied , kids ! ) .  and as clich ? d as it might be to say . . . it's usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such .  other films that this one reminded me of include henry : portrait of a serial killer and the blair witch project , with that same real sense of dread , brooding and terror .  the film does however move awfully slow and if you really don't get " into " it completely ( you really need to concentrate here ) , you will lose the motion of the story and the pent-up tension might be released .  but overall , this film is yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight .  and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can , how can you go wrong ?  definitely not a film for everyone but a must-see for anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed ( count me in ! ) .  stanley kubrick would be proud !  oh yeah . . . so  where's that gun again . . . ?  where's joblo coming from ?  the blair witch project ( 4/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the haunting ( 3/10 ) - the house on haunted hill ( 7/10 ) - lost highway ( 10/10 ) - the pledge ( 6/10 ) - the shining ( 9/10 ) - the sixth sense ( 8/10 ) - unbreakable ( 8/10 )  
1 seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p . m . at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater #2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic's pass .  [theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture]  modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes .  the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it .   " your friends and neighbors " takes a different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends .  one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story .  firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras .  everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative .  but to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult .  labute's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll .  for the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic .  another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus .  we're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown .  the film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater .  no one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background .  we're simply dropped in on the characters' lives and are expected to figure out the rest .  the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives .  first there's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don't know what they're problem is .  barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else .  mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something .  labute's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two .  obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow .  another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything .  their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship .  if only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area .  it's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ?  what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ?  labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it's fascinating .  two other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) .  cary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word " bastard . "  somehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way .  he's the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he's secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him .  patric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is .  cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her .  she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another .  she's a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable .  i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others' action , as that's the hook of the film .  the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each's scenarios , but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom .  the result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating .  for a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character's guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them .  one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be .  since the characters only interact with each other there isn't much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it .  are we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ?  i don't know of anyone going through the same situations as these people .  often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie .  but what this film does have that the others don't is repercussions in the end .  although the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren't immortal .  in what way " your friends and neighbors " is supposed to work is open to interpretation .  it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically .  still , it's an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective .  
0 the premise of turbulence is i'm sure very familiar to us all .  we've seen it before in passenger 57 , executive decision , and countless other flicks that are good in there own way .  you know , terrorists take over a plane , ask the police on the ground for what they what and so on .  turbulence starts out with a " convict " ray liotta being accused of a crime .  you think there is no way he could have done it , he's so open and kind .  he is taken in and is subsequently transported on a commerical plane to la .  this is already a problem .  there is no way that convicts would be transported on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on .  anyway , it is christmas eve and everyone is waiting to get to la and spend christmas eve there .  well , convict one manages to stop the flight in its proverbial " tracks " and liotta , still as calm as ever , takes the other convict out .  he also has eyes for lauren holly , a flight attendent , and seems to grow closer to her .   " the plot stops here "  i didn't like this movie because it seemed to be a rip off of every other airplane movie i've ever seen .  at one point , mr . liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining ( i'm serious ! ) .  it was like they stole for every other movie down to a " t " .  the only reason i did not give this 0 stars is because it had some okay stunts .  don't even bother !  
1 at one point during brian de palma's crime epic scarface , the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves : " can't you stop saying 'fuck' all the time ? "  fucking good question , that .  it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride , but as far as i can tell oliver stone's script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history .  yet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palma's scarface is remembered for , because this is a damn fine gangstar flick .  the overall structure is similar to howard hawks' 1932 original , but this time the scene has switched to miami , florida and our anti-hero's chosen vice is cocaine traffiking .  pacino , sporting a thick cuban accent , gives one the best performances of his career ( golden globe nominated ) as tony montana , a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream .  and live it out he does , with lashings of violence , abuse , murder and the funny white powder .  from his earliest jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen , tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that he's not a man to be fucked ( sorry ) .  soon he's the king of the cocaine heap , but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing .   " never do your own stash " , warns one character early in the film .  as sure as night follows day , the emperor of miami eventually falls .  writer oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here .  stone's script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development .  montana is fascinating ; uneducated but calculating , a straight shooter who speaks from the heart ; an ambitious , violent man yet one with a conscience .  a man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister , not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy , dangerous world which he inhabits .  pacino is dynamite , taking to the role with a brooding , bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting .  pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life .  only once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children , and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends , and she's happy to oblige .  this isn't as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stone's was in casino , but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well .  as director , de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva .  the escalating tension he creates in various mob situations - a drug deal gone wrong , an assination attempt - is often thrilling , and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola .  where he differs from , say , coppola's godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment .  coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep , whereas in scarface de palma opts for a grittier feel .  and it perfectly suits the material .  the only major botch is giorgio moroder's mostly crap synthesier score .  it's just not right , and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes .  as expected , scarface is very violent at times , but you shouldn't be watching gangster movies if that upsets you .  at over two and a half hours in length it's a true epic , and if you're a fan of the genre you'll love f * * k-filled minute of it .  
1  ( dimension films , " scream 2 " 's distributor , has asked press to say extremely little -- if anything -- about the film's twisty plot .  that's no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here , but i will do my best to be vague ( now , there's a first ) . )   " the first one was [good] , but all the rest sucked , " said a cinematically-savvy teen in last winter's wes craven thriller " scream , " her statement referring to the films of the " nightmare on elm street " series but really putting down franchise overkill in general .  the comment certainly carries clout : for every truly great sequel , there appears to be a couple of duds , making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas .  but like it or not , along comes " scream 2 . " and believe it or not , it's a doozy -- a slick , sinister , madly subversive good time at the movies , as intent on sending up hollywood's sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions .   " scream 2 " is definitely that rare movie thing -- a follow-up that can stand along side its original with pride .  it's been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch-esque get-ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro , california .  those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives .  plucky heroine sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college ; her pop culture-whiz pal randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) has tagged along .  trash tabloid reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a best-seller based on their ordeal , the basis of which has been turned into a ( very bad ) movie called " stab . "  and dewey riley ( david arquette ) , still suffering from wounds inflicted during " scream , " has left his job as a police officer for a while .  life is tranquil . . .  at least for a while .  several sudden murders bring sidney , randy , gale and dewey together again , but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings -- if these four people learned anything from the past , it's to trust no one .  thus , the possible victim/potential killer list includes said quartet , as well as : derek ( jerry o'connell ) , sidney's new beau ; cici ( sara michelle gellar ) , a chatty sorority gal ; joel ( duane martin ) , gale's cameraman who's not too thrilled with her blood-soaked past ; hallie ( elise neal ) , sidney's sassy roommate ; debbie ( laurie metcalf ) , a local reporter who gives gale some not-too-friendly competition ; and mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , randy's good friend and fellow film student .  cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother's murder in scream , also shows up on campus -- but why ?  like the first scream , craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang .  this time , it's an extended sequence that finds an african-american couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a sneak preview of " stab , " making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non-roles of blacks in slasher cinema .  before tragedy ensues at the screening , the movie-within-a-movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments , including a scene from " stab " which turns scream's now-famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear .   ( " b---- , hang up the phone and star-69 his a-- ! "  pinkett yells at the screen . )  it's funny , creepy stuff ( i don't think i'll ever feel safe in a movie theater again ) that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road .  another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone-assault of the killer on randy , dewey and gale in broad daylight ; it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters .  there are other superb set pieces , but explaining them risks ruining their effect .  there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count .  it's something of a trade-in -- the new characters are too large in number to be as fully-developed as the original " scream " gang , but this movie packs in knowing performances ( especially by kennedy and cox ) and more death for your dollar .  it can be argued that , while the original might outclass it by a tad , scream 2 is both scarier and funnier .  it certainly doesn't skimp with shocks -- a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart ( i actually questioned craven and williamson's judgment here , considering how much this person has added to these films ) .  sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab -- the two scenes we're shown are dead-on -- but for film fans , there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like " the usual suspects , " " aliens " and " the empire strikes back . "  still , " scream 2 " does so many things right , it's petty to quibble .  its penchant for parody is irresistible , discussions of the merits of film sequels and all .  the attractive , solid cast is a definite bonus .  and the denouement ( while not as shocking as " scream " 's ) is priceless ; the film's final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in " scream " with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper .  all this and a " scream 3 " is in the works .  knowing the series' tendency for self-reference , perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice .  mentioning " scream 2 " 'll help them in their argument .  
0 vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico .  the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out .  while the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence .  that is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line .  but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene .  then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that .  the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end .  and that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire$ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery .  this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it .  what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires .  there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore .  anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans .  this has not always been carpenter's style .  his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film's central science fictional question .  jack crow heads a vampire swat team , cleaning up nests of vampires with high-tech spears and crossbows .  in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is .  now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) .  to make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust .  meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico .  if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that's exactly what it is .  the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin .  but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people , don't tell them .  just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown .  fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding , why are the vampires in new mexico--what do they want and why do they want it , what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church , how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it ?  the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but instead are revealed through dialog .  now if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses the james wood persona .  woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well .  but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio-leone- style mythic posturing .  while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target .  woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero .  that is not his style and it just does not work very well .  there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses .  in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor .  one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair .  as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down .  one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret .  these vampires do not maintain a low profile .  there are arguably logical flaws in the film .  there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires .  it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight .  i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out .  while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  perhaps i will read the book .  
1 since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they're portraying , it's fitting to say that " beloved " come as a real shock as a film .  it's confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i've seen all year , and that's not necessarily because of the three-hour running time .   " beloved " is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , " beloved " comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) .   " beloved " tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children .  when the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family .  sethe is proud , though , and will not move .  her sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation .  a couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging .  he has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot .  when he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies " it ain't evil .  it's just sad . "  some more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears .  but when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house .  her name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills .  she stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk .  they let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down .   " beloved " acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story .  most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts .  sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , " they took my milk ! "  worst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back .  she runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don't leave them alone .  when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn't regret it .  she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing .  of course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren't flat out told that until later on in the film .  beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long .  thus , " beloved " becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , " solaris , " where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system .  that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely .   " beloved " moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable .  the most interesting films are the ones that don't explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense .  sethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she's being played by oprah winfrey .  it's been well over a decade since her last major performance in " the color purple , " but judging from these two films , i'll bet she's one of the best actresses working today . . . if  she was strictly an actress .  her talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that's a shame because she brings so much to this movie .  emotion .  sadness .  strength .  watching the strong sethe , who's so afraid of the past that she's built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great .  she makes it real .  that's not to say this is a perfect film .  in fact , i'd wager to say that the fact that it's confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is .  while oprah's performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i'm dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn't show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film .  it doesn't necessarily move as though they're memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore .  but despite its tediousness , perhaps that's the point .  the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality .  and for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be .  jonathan demme's direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters .  there's more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism .  the acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination .  everyone has been raving about thandie newton's performance , and how it should be rewarded .  however , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part .  act like a baby .  throw things .  stumble around .  chew food with your mouth open .  i do think there's another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it's kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother's loss of reality towards the end .  it's not that newton isn't great : she's as annoying and wacky as the role demands .  it's just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better .  despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , " beloved " has still not done well .  costing , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two .  unfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic " caligula , " the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) .  although i respect " beloved , " i can't say that i really enjoyed it .  
0 ah , and 1999 was going along so well , too .   " she's all that " has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie i've seen so far this year .  and quite frankly , i doubt i'll see anything equally bad .   ( at least , i * hope * i don't see anything equally bad ) .   " she's all that " tells the story of the most popular guy in school ( played by freddie prinze jr . ) who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school ( rachel leigh cook ) into the most popular .  that , right there , is problem #1 .  how many times have we seen this storyline ?  as cook comments near the end of the film , " it's kind of like " pretty woman " , except without the prostitution " .  of course , had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material , the well-worn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward .  as it is , though , " she's all that " relies * completely * on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead .  there's not one original or interesting character in the film , either , and if that wasn't bad enough , there's not one good performance featured .  the star of the movie , rachel leigh cook , is simply horrible .  i usually don't like to get so personal , but in this case , i think it needs to be said .  cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was .  i was never convinced that she was a " nerd " , and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary .  the movie seems to be saying it's better to be popular than to be who you are .  as for freddie prinze jr . , an actor i ordinarily enjoy , he too is quite bad here .  he coasts through the film on so-called charm , and never establishes a real character .  kieren culkin is here , too , as the brother of cook .  and for some indiscernable reason , he's got hearing aids .  no explanation is given and they're never brought up .  were we supposed to feel * sorry * for him just because he wore hearing aids ?  i don't think so .  that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things i've seen in a movie in a long time .   " she's all that " sucks .  that's what it boils down to .  it's not entertaining , and it's not even a good time passer .  the hour and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair-removal system informercial .  and what's worse , it sends out a bad message to teens .  it appears to be telling them , " hey , it doesn't matter if you're happy the way you are .  that's unimportant .  if you want to * truly * be happy , dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubble-headed moron . "  ugh .  
1 in present day hanoi , three sisters reflect on their parents' relationship while trying to define their own in writer/director tran anh hung's ( " the scent of green papaya " ) " the vertical ray of the sun . "  youngest sister lien ( tran nu yen-khe ) greets the day with hai ( ngo quanq hai ) , the only brother whom she rooms and relentlessly flirts with .  their morning ritual of tai chi and lou reed precedes crossing the street to eldest sister suong's ( nguyen nhu quynh ) cafe , where lien works , for breakfast .  the three sisters lovingly prepare their mother's memorial banquet of traditional delicacies , prepared as much for look as taste , while giggling over the differences between the sexes .  after the family breaks from the banquet , we learn that suong's young son 'little monkey' is doted upon , but there's a distance developing with her husband quoc ( chu ngoc hung ) , who's leaving for one of his habitual botanical photography trips .  middle sister khanh ( tran manh cuong ) tells her writer husband she's pregnant before he leaves on a trip to saigon to research tuan , a mysterious man in his mother-in-law's past .  lien keeps crawling into hai's bed at night , causing him to fall out of it .  the initial serenity we witnessed starts turning into a soap opera before coming to full circle one month later , as the three women prepare their father's memorial banquet .   " the vertical ray of the sun " is a contemplative piece where strong passions exist underneath calm exteriors .  sly humor , self deceit and harsh truths all exist in the cyclic screenplay .  tran anh hung and his cinematographer mark lee ping-bin ( " flowers of shanghai " ) linger over and repeat the small gestures of everyday life - a wife washes her husbands hands , a woman makes water dance in a bowl , a man pulls his lover to face him before they part .  small spaces such as rooms , alleys and courtyards create intimacy .  the color green , symbolizing life and tranquility , is used heavily in the film's visual styling , lapsing into yellowish hues and blues .  writer/director tran anh hung's film recalls ang lee's " eat drink man woman , " another tale of three sisters of varying modernity coming together traditionally for a parent .  but while lee's more traditionally story-driven film resulted in radical changes for all concerned , " the vertical ray of the sun's " characters strive for peaceful harmony .  watching it is like trailing your fingertips in a stream on a cool spring day .  
0  " goodbye , lover " sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may , and one look will tell you why .  it's a mess .  and that's * way * before ellen degeneres shows up .  the film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that , in this case , required the services of three screenwriters .  i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller , one wrote a murder mystery , and one wrote a comedy , then director roland joff ? tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment .  i didn't laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to ) .  degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair .  either degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn't yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist .  every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip , but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid .  her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is " at least she died healthy . "  and that's one of her wittier asides .  degeneres' sgt .  rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of . . . wait .  to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple-crosses .  it's best described this way :  sultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake , a " creative yet unfocused " ( and alcoholic ) advertising rep , played by dermot mulroney .  sandra likes to act out her deep-seated sexual fantasies and jake's brother ben ( the suave-as-ever don johnson ) likes to help .  ben is also coming on to his petite , mousy co-worker peggy blaine ( mary-louise parker ) and someone , somewhere , is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his .  the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again .  although there are some genuine surprises , the plot twists get too contrived too quickly .  probably around the time degeneres' gumcracking gumshoe appears .  at least the former " ellen " star is going for something a little different .  arquette turns in yet another of her stiletto-heeled , platinum blonde bombshell roles ( see : " lost highway , " " true romance " ) while quoting embarrassing lines like " i'm not wearing any underwear . "  i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this .  here's an example of some of the film's flat-out stupidity .  sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film's duplicitous lovers .  she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite " the sound of music " on her car stereo , intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims .  so what was the point of the wig and the car ?   " the sound of music " stuff might be a reference to " the wizard of oz " allusions in david lynch's " wild at heart , " but if so joff ? must have forgotten that " wild at heart " was a despicable movie .  it's hard to believe that " goodbye , lover " was directed by the same person who made " the killing fields " and " the mission . "  it's not , however , hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long .  it should have stayed there .  
0 bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action pictures .  mercury rising adds to a growing list ( including such stinkers as the jackal , last man standing , striking distance and the last boy scout ) of stale actioners he has headlined .  and though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix , it is every bit as stale .  art jeffries ( bruce willis ) is your typical tormented fbi agent .  you know the type , haunted by his job , yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist .  enter simon ( miko hughes ) , an autistic boy , who , like rain man and all other autistic people , is a savant .  he can merely gaze at a super-encrypted message , and , while little computer beeps go off in his head , he can understand what it says .  naturally , this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government .  lt . col . nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) , an nsa official bubbling over with evil , has spent countless time and money implementing the newest " unbreakable " code , mercury .  however , when two of his underlings ( robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman ) publish a mercury-encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness , simon cracks the code .  naturally , this infuriates kudrow , who sends a terminator-like hitman ( l . l .  ginter ) to eliminate the security hazard .  and that's where art jeffries comes in .  for some reason that's never explained in the film , the fbi is called in to help , and through a series of intricate machinations , art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy .  in a few unrealistic sequences , he enlists the aid of a stranger , stacey ( kim dickens ) , to help out , but she is given very little to do overall .  the central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous .  why bother trying to kill the kid . . . i  mean , who would know ?  it's not like the kid ( or anyone else for that matter ) knew he was cracking a government super-cypher .  and even if he is eliminated , what does that help ?  he's already proven that mercury can be broken .  there's always the chance that someone else would crack it . . . but  i guess without a kid in jeopardy , there's not much of a movie here .  for all its faults , the film actually starts relatively well ( once you pass the painfully familiar teaser ) .  the film flirts with developing real characters , and a semblance of a plot . . . then  mr . terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill . . . quickly .  miko hughes does a decent job , for his age , at creating a touching performance .  however , don't go to this film looking for any new insights into autism ( not that many people will ) .  instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddy-cop movie ( think cop and a half . . . with a twist ! )  willis and baldwin are just overplaying to type .  rather than creating a nuanced character , baldwin simply oozes sliminess .  and for willis' part , he simply recycles the stock role of the loner cop/fbi agent ( which he has honed in the die hard series ) .  as almost an afterthought , about halfway through , the film carelessly gives him a character trait ( an addiction ) , and then drops it in the next scene .  but the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay .  this film wasn't well thought out at all .  the film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible .  the carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member .  at first the bad scenes just trickle in , but by the gruesomely bad finale they're a veritable flood .  the film's few decent moments come in the form of bad jokes ( mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode ) .  but they're not nearly enough to make the film worthwhile .  mercury rising is a thriller that you're more likely to groan at than cheer .  
0 capsule : annoyingly unentertaining , obvious and paper-thin buddy/cop/drug/sexy-witness movie .  presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock .  i've seen this movie already , i said , as i looked at the box art .  no , i haven't even seen a trailer for the movie ; i don't even know what it's about , but i can look at the way they're promoting it , and i know i've seen it already .  i thought : it's about these two cops .  and they're buddies , sort of .  they're at each other's throats a lot , but they really do like each other .  and everyone else in their department hates them 'cause they're hot-shots .  and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship .  and one day they're in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying .  and the bad guy is a drug lord .  and there's a witness , and she's this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way .  and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down .  i only missed the bit about the badges .  the rest i got dead-on .  and i hadn't even left the video store yet .  the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence , and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo .  smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money ; martin l . is a family man ( shades of the now-tired lethal weapon dynamic here ) whose wife and he are at total odds .  this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence's " not getting any " , and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house , thinking his partner is now his wife's " back door man " .  not funny ; tiresome .  bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence .  will smith is a natural , and i'm happy to see him in movies like six degrees . . .  and men in black .  he's funny and charming without trying to be ; he really does seem to be enjoying himself .  martin lawrence is a different story ; he's so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial .  movies like this are not about originality .  i know this .  they are about style and energy and synergy between actors .  i know this , too .  and yet , while watching bad boys , which its glamorous photography and impossibly exact stunt choreography , i felt fed up .  i'd seen con air , which despite being completely implausible , was still great fun , because it tried however feebly to put some new life into the mix .  bad boys is a dry run -- and overlong , too , clocking in at just over two hours with a lot more by-play than i felt could be justified .  i could write this movie .  you could write this movie .  many people have .  many people will continue to write this movie , over and over again .  other people will buy it from them , and make it , and we will pay money to see it .  more the fools we all .  in a terrifyingly prescient line from his book a scanner darkly , phil k . dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger ( as he called it ) would eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural and financial exchange .  one day we will all just sit in our living rooms and sell the same burger back and forth to each other .  the same could be said about this movie .  i have the sinking feeling we're going to see it again .  soon .  
0 i can't recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota .  for forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt .  then , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another .  feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face .  feeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him .  red's punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie's dreams .  enter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam's estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie's eye and have sex with her in the bathroom .  united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn't ready to let them go without a fight .  freddie , meanwhile , isn't ready to let sam's money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations .  there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam's intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father .  it does a great job of setting up jjaks' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves' wounded look is just right for jjaks .  the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin .  most important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements' " i will dare " on the car radio .  you would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota .  unfortunately , you would be dead wrong .  i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn't expect what i got .  what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality .  suddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable .  the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations .  vincent d'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood .  there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme's something wild and neil jordan's the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn't try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment .  i don't want to dismiss baigelman's successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper .  it _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can't make his two halves into a whole .  feeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there's not much funny about that .  
1 some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the '80s .  since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen , i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level .  bio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account .  it's rare that a movie with the moniker " based on the life of ? " comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining .  raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre .  the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the '40s and '50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen .  for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying .  historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion's share of the details culled from la motta's own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage ) .  however , although la motta is credited as the movie's " consultant , " he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout .  the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage .  sex and violence are inextricably linked .  the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull .  in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them .  outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled .  the two people who spar with him on life's canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci ) .  these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses .  he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence .  raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class .  over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match .  meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife .  vicki becomes jake's greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain .  his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him .  hence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother .   ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : " are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? " )  in the late '40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall .  he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing .  two years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray .  by the late '50s and early '60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine .  raging bull is the other side of rocky .  sylvester stallone's tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 .  it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production .  but , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring .  while scorsese's primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working .  rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased .  there's little i can say here that hasn't already said about de niro's performance .  in a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding .  the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering .  and , although there's a lot of travis bickle ( de niro's character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him .  this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting .  as the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit .  as the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form .  how many actors would go that far ?  the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance .  cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) .  their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro's .  pesci , who has basically re-created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother .  the misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed .  but , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it's startling to behold .  moriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake .  later , she's called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear .  scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few " home movie " segments are in color ) .  the choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black-and-white approach is almost unheard of .   ( one important recent exception , schindler's list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . )  in black-and-white ( especially considering scorsese's choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing .  there's no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas .  during fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta's perspective .  scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta's loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown .  after that , his career was all downhill .  yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta's future .  the reason is obvious : scorsese isn't as interested in boxing as he is in the character .  following his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies .  we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self .  who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando's speech from on the waterfront ?   ( " i coulda been a contenda . " )  perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the '80s .  and , if not , it's certainly perilously close to the zenith .  
1 i don't know what movie the critics saw , but it wasn't this one .  the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring .  in my personal opinion , they couldn't be more wrong .  if you were expecting airplane ! -like  laughs and agatha christie-intense mystery , then yes , this movie would be a disappointment .  however , if you're just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time , this is one to see .  honest , it is .  this story is about a 4th network , wbn , taking to america's airwaves in 1939 .  penny henderson ( mary stuart masterson ) , the station owner's secretary , must deal with her overbearing boss , an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment's notice , partly due to the fact that they haven't been paid in weeks .  among the mayhem , she must also deal with her soon-to-be ex-husband , roger ( brian benben ) who desperately wants her back .  unfortunately , her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation .  while trying to woo penny back , roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn .  mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny ( i'm trying to be unbiased so i won't tell you how amazing she looked ) , although brian benben gets most of the screen time .  along with the two leads , are several recognizable faces , including corbin bernsen ( l . a .  law ) , michael mckean ( laverne & shirley ) and bobcat goldthwait .  the special effects are amazing , and fooled me ( which some may argue isn't very difficult to do ) in many scenes .  although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy , it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie .  overall , i gave it , or an , depending on what system you use .  some comments collected from friends :  
0 because no one demanded it : david duchovny in a romantic comedy !  at last , both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources !  the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot , which could be fodder for a valentine's day episode of " the x-files . "  bob rueland ( david duchovny ) loses his wife elizabeth ( joely richardson ) in a car accident .  at the same time , grace briggs ( minnie driver ) is in the hospital , waiting for a heart transplant .  grace gets elizabeth's heart , and it leads her to bob .  it's the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer and then is driven to slaughter people .  four writers are credited with contributing to the story .  that doesn't seem possible .  despite being a solid two hours long , " return to me " adds little to the " boy meets girl / boy loses girl " formula and , as a result , is terribly tedious and slow-moving .  duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks , and i kept wishing for a fast-forward button to move their scenes along .  since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before , i blame duchovny .  he's out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series ( and i've always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on " the x-files " comes off more sibling-like than hot-and-bothered ) .  there's something about duchovny that makes me uneasy .  regardless of the role he's playing , he comes off as a weirdo .  the only redeeming quality of " return to me " is its hilarious supporting cast .  the circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker , and they generate the only laughs in the movie .  carroll o'connor is grace's grandfather marty o'reilly .  when bob comes into marty's restaurant after hours , marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status .  when marty discovers that bob is a widower , he invites bob to join his poker game and introduces him with the declaration , " this is bob !  his wife is dead ! "  the poker buddies are just as desperate to find a mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news .  also funny : bonnie hunt as grace's best friend megan and james belushi as megan's husband joe .  married with children , megan and joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance .  although it's rare to see him in a movie that premieres in a theater , belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill .  rounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob's best friend and robert loggia as marty's brother-in-law angelo .  in only the lead actors lived up to the standards set by the rest of the cast .  bottom line : if you are compelled to see this movie , watch it on video so you can fast-forward to scenes with carroll o'connor and james belushi .  
0 in " the astronaut's wife , " charlize theron plays a young woman with a nervous demeanor , pixie-hairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in her belly .  if only her name wasn't jillian , the makers of this embarrassing bit of sci-fi shlock could have come up with a far more appropriate title : " rosemary's species . "  what a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron - oscar-worthy in " the devil's advocate " - struggle with the lamest rip-off of a screendom classic in recent memory .  ok , maybe " the astronaut's wife " deviates from " rosemary's baby " turf for its set-up , which finds our heroine terrorized not by satan's minions but her possessed husband ( johnny depp ) , a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him , um , a changed man .  predictably , he and the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant , his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great " bowfinger " line about " alien love . "  theron's " advocate " character faced a similar dilemma , the horror there resonating strongly .   " astronaut " provides only artificial anxiety .  last year's equally noodle-headed " species ii " spun a similar premise about the breeding habits of an extraterrestrial on earth , but at least that movie more or less knew it was garbage .   " the astronaut's wife " is grave and humor-free , passing its increasingly silly story off as full-fledged serious , right down to an ambiguous finale that isn't even going to satisfy those who've stayed with it thus far .  here's a hint : it involves lots of water , electrical equipment , a special effect from " the abyss " and the tots who doubled up as adam sandler's co-star in " big daddy . "  draw your own conclusions .  director/writer rand ravich coats the proceedings in dynamic sights masterminded by legendary " e . t . "  cinematographer allen daviau , but too often favors the film's visual presentation over the story he's trying to tell .  this bodes horribly for each dramatic development , like the surfacing of a suspicious nasa official ( " speed " 's joe morton ) to instigate jill's slow and stupid comprehension of the truth .  his hyper-erratic behavior is probably supposed to give wife a paranoid edge .  instead , he adds to the phoniness .  theron and depp are certainly beyond this junk and will get other chances to prove themselves this fall - she as part of an imposing ensemble case in the john irving adaptation " cider house rules , " he in the lead of tim burton's eagerly-awaited " sleepy hollow . "  undeserving of such talent , " the astronaut's wife " manages to be derivative , dull and uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional laughs .  in space , no one can hear you scream .  but in a movie theatre , everyone can hear you snore .  
0 okay , bear with me y'all , cause first off i have to get this off my chest :  what the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ?  whew . okay .  cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end , as cute as the crab maybe .  even i know that you need more footage than * that * .  and that wasn't the only thing getting on my nerves .  the cutesy gimmicks , saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flannery ( as tom ) might have held some appeal during , oh , say the first 10 minutes of the movie .  at first the movie moves along at a quick , interesting pace .  it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street , whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesn't * die .  a ridiculous concept , yes , but at this point i'm willing to accept it because i'm willing to accept that this is how amanda's life is changed , how her powers are received .  later on , the movie can't seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom .  and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying ; they weren't just repetitive , they were out of place and unnecessary .  the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed , sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development ( amanda suddenly becoming a great chef , her falling in love with tom , etc . ) , sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good .  some places the plot just doesn't make sense , sometimes it's way too contrived ( the crab bit , for example ) , and sometimes too corny ( peaches emitting dry ice .  can't beat that ) .  all in all the plot seemed fragmented , unconnected .  not romantic at all , and only funny in some places .  so , okay , do the magic powers come from the crab ?  or the fairy godfather ?  she can * float * now too ?  and all of a sudden , instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches , she can put her emotions into her food ?  tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda's " witchcraft " in the end ?  would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac's video ?  what the hell is up with that damn crab ?  it is unfortunate , because i liked the basic premise of the movie , until it became too fantastical and tiresome .  the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while , but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables .  the humor was good in some places ( nolan gets the funniest bits , including that incomprehensible , totally random thing with the dolls ) .  gellar and flannery are qualified actors , and gellar has a particular charm , but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy ( or even annette in the upcoming " cruel intentions " ) than this sorry excuse for a character .  it's almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is , or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible .  the supporting character nolan was a highlight , though he reminded me a bit of kevin in " you've got mail " ( see footnotes ) .  and , as always , typical of a chick flick / romantic comedy , there's a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background , cued up at all the right places .  this sort of got on the nerves after a while , too .   " simply irresistible " is not hard to understand , light , funny in some places , and generally disappointing because it can't draw the line between romance and protracted sap , between humor and tired slapstick .  and how could i refrain from making a pun ?   .   .   .   " simply irresistible " is all too easy to resist .   ( first viewing , 2/6/99 )   * did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to " you've got mail " ( or " the shop around the corner " ) ?  business rivals fall in love .  female counterpart's business is in danger of being shut down .  female as mother- like figure guiding her .  the annoying , hysterical ex-girlfriends .   * i _really_ like sarah michelle gellar's wardrobe .  
1 seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8 . 50 .  [theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture]   ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface .  i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . )  as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ?  never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old .  never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released .  never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything .  and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader .  before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs ) .  as has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one ) .  george lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically .  in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons .  with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . .  second trilogy . . .  well you know what i mean ) .  and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution .  [critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule .  critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it . '  because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ]  first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it .  we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire .  we know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . '  we also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) .  what we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth .  to me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity .  also , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended .  most notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine .  for those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) .  with `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights .  unfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained .  i didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness .  if you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) .  but i digress .  i've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself .  all these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself .  what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s .  its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality .  the basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times .  we're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo .  we're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly .  we're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) .  the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) .  the leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears .  he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series .  sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person .  clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers .  i have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) .  but it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along .  the film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another .  there are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook .  the other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting .  the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits .  as we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story .  and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council .  to briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation .  their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force .  jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves .  this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before .  in fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before .  the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary .  by the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot .  it's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence .  not that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history .  and at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter .  it does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society .  `the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness .  so many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited .  but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies .  
0 i should have known , damn it , i should have known .  ewan mcgregor - codename : " eye " - is pointing a high-tech rifle-ly gadget at a fat , bald business-oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street .  we get the requisite electro-green through-the-sight view .  we the audience , seeing a high tech rifle-ly gadget , of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target , but instead , he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy , low-quality photographs , which eye then proceeds to fax and e-mail to everyone in his target's office .  all right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle/camera , but i was still open minded . . .  maybe there's a really good reason for it .  i've got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor's previous work . . .  and he's obi wan ke- friggin-nobi for god's sake .  and director stephan elliot's last movie priscilla , queen of the desert was a quirky little delight .  there's some genuine talent involved here .  i think at the twenty minute mark , there was still a spark of hope in my heart .  eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization's son ( i still have no idea what this organization was - british intelligence ?  national spy ring ?  private investigation ? ) , who is apparently stealing from his trust fund .  he has received his assignment from k . d .  lang , through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase .  when eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house , he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard .  ok , that's odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting .  then she starts to cry , and through her tears exclaims " merry christmas , dad ! "  for the first time .  so begins our tale of obsession . . .  or . . . something .  the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar .  throughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras .  fine , that's a lovely premise , i suppose .  but gosh darn it , if you're going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation .  and that's precisely where this film fails .  this is the kind of movie that pisses me off .  it's an abortion , a collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end .  it pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller .  here , the filmmakers have confused " surreal " and " deep " with " vaguely unclear " and " crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors . "  i never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in " love " with this woman who changes wigs and kills people .  the movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense .  explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye's imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he shouldn't leave ms . judd .  explanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : " beauty is in the eye of the beholder . "  whoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed .  that's as deep as it gets , folks .  there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade mad lib .  there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was .  my personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms . judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley's awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop-who-sees-ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and- then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot .  each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last .  the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space .  any time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed .  bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass .  ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell .  jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks , then laughs maniacally . . .  cut to random guy with eye patch . . .  iguana out of focus . . .  iguana comes into focus .  wow , man .  when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no surprise to me .  there are plenty of elements here that , if extended and fleshed out more , would have made for a decent story .  and i wouldn't be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere , or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director's cut . . .  not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing .  the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition .  some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone , and this time i didn't particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap ; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking .  someone near cell-phone-guy did eventually yell , " shut the hell up ! " , but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen .  
1 ingredients : neophyte lawyer , legal situations , corrupt insurance company ,  synopsis : rudy baylor ( matt damon ) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time .  rudy's girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband ; rudy's elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded , and ; the family of rudy's friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldn't pay for a bone marrow transplant .  rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned , but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser ( danny devito ) who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge ( danny glover ) .  jon voight plays leo f . drummond , the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all-powerful insurance company's team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice .  will rudy defeat leo ?  will he enjoy being a lawyer ?  opinion : the good news is that this movie has a happy ending , and it features a guy trying to do the right thing .  director francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie .  in the typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on solving it , and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins ( after lots of gripping courtroom drama ) .  however , coppola's movie is deliberately more low key .  'the rainmaker' plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters .  in the background rudy's voice narrates his feelings and makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general .  two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be .  first , rudy's time is split juggling three cases , rather than concentrating on a single high-stakes case .  also , rudy's use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge .  the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win , and rudy narrates his way into coming of age .  
1 steven spielberg's " amistad , " which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who " owned " them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story .  first , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery .  second , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) .  last , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade .   " amistad " succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements .  i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another " anti-slavery " movie .  having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn't already know about it .  fortunately , i turned out to be wrong .  for one thing , spielberg's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa , so " amistad " was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning .  and some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery .  one scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their " excess " slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year .  spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating .  the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time .  exposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation .  the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court .  the biggest success of " amistad " is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court .  through cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ .  cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles .   " what kind of country is this , where laws 'almost' work ? " he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court .  spielberg's direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque's angry outburst in the court room .  still , there isn't enough of this for it to be a serious problem .  the main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can't quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie .  this summer's contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once .   " amistad " tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through .  perhaps the best way to describe it is this : " amistad " is three four star films edited into one .  almost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts .  however , i can't honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery .  
1 urban legend surprised me .  based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena .  thankfully , legend rose above it's soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year .  you're all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who's identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody's favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the  only person you didn't suspect !  however , just because legend doesn't really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can't qualify as first-class entertainment .  it was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i've had at the movies all year .  the thing is , i'm not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive .  maybe it was the above-par performances by the movie's two leads ( jared leto and " cybil " actress alicia witt ) .  or , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks .  more likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise .  i don't think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman .  urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film .  a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill .  one problem , though .  would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ?  i thought not .  predictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company .  it's odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody's on the other line .  naturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off .  and the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! !  a decapitation .  it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car .  so who is it this time ?  the obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends .  a-ha .  or could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ?  like all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit .  and it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn't suspect .  i'm not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due .  and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun .   * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi , ca  
0 when considering david fincher's latest film , " the game " , four words come to mind .   " don't believe the hype . "  this michael douglas vehicle , from the director of " seven " , isn't nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe .  the film draws us in with an intriguing concept ( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer ) where a jaded millionaire ( douglas ) is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy .  this isn't simply virtual reality .  this is real life with a deadly twist .  on his 48th birthday , nicholas van orton ( douglas ) is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother , conrad ( sean penn ) .  conrad has a special birthday present for his brother .  he hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services .   " they make your life fun , " conrad tells him .  nicholas humors his brother , telling him he'll call , but it's clear he has no time for any foolish , " fantasy role-playing , " as he calls it .  then , for reasons that are never really made clear , nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they're all about .  he ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process , which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have .  nevertheless , when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client , the weird things start happening .  of course , when we've only covered about 30 minutes of screen time , what else should we expect .  douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful , violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands .  one of those films , " basic instinct " , came from the creative minds of writer , joe eszterhas and director , paul verhoeven .  the premise of " the game , " is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film , " total recall . "  in that case , the premise was implanting someone else's memories as a way to enhance one's own life through a dream vacation .  yet , in both films , the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience .  we live the adventure along with the protagonist , reacting to each twist and turn .  in theory , the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isn't .  all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride , when the truth is finally revealed .  now , for those of you who forgot , let me say this again .   " don't believe the hype . "   " the game " is not a thrilling roller coaster ride .  as a suspense-thriller , it doesn't do much but spin in circles .  by the third reel , i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot .  is it any wonder douglas won't be able to resist the charms of a mysterious , potentially life-threatening blonde ( ever heard of glenn close ?  no ? well , how about sharon stone ?  thought so ) .  if anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven't seen that many films .  there is no suspense here .  trust me , i looked hard to find some .  i had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations .  fincher aim's for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas .  there are those that might say " the game " is not intended to be viewed literally .  i would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film .  the film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues .  there is a moment early in the film where van orton , realizing his game has begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who's in on the whole thing .  he is charged by his paranoia .  he is looking at the world through new eyes .  it is the last thought-provoking moment in the film .  from there on , the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us .  any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device .  at the outset , we're told each " game " is tailored to the individual .  ultimately , this " game " is supposed to work like a crucible , trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire , proving his soul .  yet , as douglas endures his personal gauntlet , we're given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is .  i wanted to like this film more than i did .  i look at it as just anothergreat idea , poorly realized .  i can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn't mean we were seeing what was really happening .  bryan singer's " the usual suspects " for one , a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas .  also , there is the underrated " jacob's ladder , " with tim robbins , a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism .  here are two examples of films that don't simply manipulate for manipulations' sake .  there are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place .  one major issue that comes up in " the game " is whether or not the whole " illusion " is just a highly sophisticated con game .  well , i can tell you right now , after you've spent your $7 dollars , you may be asking yourself the same thing .  
0 in china in 1982 i turned the tables on our national guide and asked him if he had any questions about america .  i guess i was expecting some sort of political question .  instead , i was dumfounded by what was most on his mind .   " in america , do wives and their mothers-in-law get along well ? "  he assured me in china that they did , but i am certain if that were true he would not have asked .  even in china people seem to have problems relating to in- laws .  perhaps some of life's most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage .  a man trying to relate to his new prospective in-laws and vice-versa could be the basis of a very strong comedy .  meet the parents does not demonstrate that fact , however .  greg focker ( played by ben stiller ) has been dating and in love with pam byrnes ( teri polo ) for ten months and is now ready to propose to her .  he will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbie's family and to attend her sister's wedding .  from the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg and jack and dina byrnes ( robert deniro and blythe danner ) .  through no fault of his own , the airline has lost greg's luggage .  and he has to ask to borrow clothing .  it is the beginning of a game of one-upmanship in which greg is nearly always one-down .  as the games go on greg is more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes .  greg is playing a game he does not understand , in a league he is new to .  but perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his father-in-law .  this film had potential in its tale of one-upmanship .  it has hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiar--one that has not been done overly frequently in films .  but the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is a little too contrived .  too many coincidences in the story work against greg .  the script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky .  certainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could , but even when he is trying to do the right things nature conspires against him .  there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy .  certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written .  the main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniro's performance .  deniro plays the suspicious and not a little fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can .  the little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities .  but we do not really see much of that digging .  ben stiller is an affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen .  it is nice to see blythe danner again on the screen .  but her character has a basic conflict between a basic decency and her love for her husband and the script should have given her more to do with that .  randy newman has written a playful score .  in the first few seconds of the film it does something creative i have never heard a film score do before .  there is a lot of source music that is popular music of the 1960s .  presumably that is what the upper class listens to at least in somebody's imagination .  humor is subjective and some this film has been getting some favorable comment .  but this is a comedy that works only occasionally for me .  i would have to rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  
0 underwater science fiction stays submerged  sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman  one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents .  you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered .  psychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash .  when he arrives at the site , he discovers that there is no plane , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 , 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years .  having written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship .  his group as outlined in his report , consists of beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician ; and ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist .  unfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team .   " after all , " he explains , " who reads government documents ? "  lead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , a top secret federal operative , the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel .  once there they stroll over , knock on the door and explore the still-operational ufo .  discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere .  when adams enters the sphere , the weirdness unfolds .  a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer .   " my name is jerry .  i am happy " flashes across the screen .  this is unsettling for the psychologist .   " what happens if jerry gets mad ? " he asks .  barnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can't put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry .  then the situation turns bad .  deadly beasts appear from nowhere .  a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel .  lethal sea snakes attack goodman .  a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading " 20 , 000 leagues under the sea " .  the suspicious scientists turn against each other .  this has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man's science fiction film .  however even the finest ingredients don't go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn't seem to care about his product .  director barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that doesn't engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes .  the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification .  it's much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances .  it doesn't get any better when the action scenes begin .  while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles , the people are still flat .  oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them .  after adams experiences the interior of the sphere , no one bothers to ask him what happened .  their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited .  even goodman and halperin's ill-conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing .  her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing .  there's a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending , but here they are far too obvious .  when an emergency mini-sub is explained , you know what's going to happen .  the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting .  chapter headings that divide the movie have no function .  the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos .  much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow .  although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable , a great deal of it isn't .  even a science fiction film must be internally consistent .  there's too much here that doesn't make sense .  are the manifestations real ?  the jellyfish kill queen latifa ( in a throw-away role ) and the squid nearly destroys the outpost , but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect .  a scene in the sub suggests that it's illusion , but earlier episodes indicate that it's not .  not everything has to be explained to death , but there are major questions that the film never answers .  where the ship came from is clarified , but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to .  even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll .  the climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale .  after pre-release audience testing , the actors were called back to re-shoot the ending .  it's difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse .  following the recent tradition of lengthy films , this weighs in at over two very long hours .  the weak scenes could have been cut , but then there wouldn't have been much left .  the movie was supposedly held up by effects work , but there's nothing special on the screen .  we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm .  stealing from " alien " , " the abyss " and the disastrous " event horizon " , this film has learned nothing from them .  remarkably levinson and hoffman's other currently showing film is " wag the dog " , a smart and entertaining piece of work .  this one could have been titled the same sans one word .  
1 director dominic sena ( who made the highly underrated kalifornia ) and producer jerry bruckheimer ( the rock , armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen .  nicolas cage plays memphis , a retired car thief who's " pulled back in " to the business by an evil car thief overlord ( christopher eccleston ) determined to kill memphis' kid brother ( giovanni ribisi ) .  memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise , all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang .  memphis sets out to put his old crew back together , but discovers that most of them have retired as well .  gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits .  in that sequence , we get a rockin' little tune from moby , along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects .  filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence , and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride .  and what follows doesn't disappoint . . .  cage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way . . .  good or bad . . .  i don't know how he does that ) , and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely .  of the supporting cast members , angelina jolie as memphis' former love is in the film just to provide eye candy ( she's definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i've ever seen ) and robert duvall as memphis' former mentor is just around to lend the film some class .  also , i'm a big fan of will patton ( armageddon , the postman ) and would love to see him get a huge role someday .  none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately .  some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles .  delroy lindo ( get shorty ) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis , as does timothy olyphant ( go ) as lindo's partner .  i just wish some of the other characters could have been as important .  the only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion . . .  mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll .  there's no doubt in anyone's mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen , and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the " rival car thief " plot line .  as it stands , that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package .  but if i was making this film , i'd have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew , thereby making memphis have to improvise . . .  thereby adding some meat to the plot .  the finale is essentially just a big car chase , and there just aren't ways to make car chases interesting anymore .  it's all been done .  the chase is also shot and edited in that " jerry bruckheimer action sequence " kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene .  sure it's a car chase , but what exactly are the particulars of it ?  it's very hard to tell .  finally , there's a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the " bus jumping the ramp " sequence from speed in the " oh , i don't think so . . . "  department .  despite those minor complaints , gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment .  it's not thought provoking , but it's shiny , loud and fun . . .  just what a summer flick should be .  [pg-13]  
1 this is a good year if you want plenty of sci-fi on your multiplex .  >from the comedies mars attacks and men in black , to luc besson's powerful the fifth element , and to this , sci-fi/horror that is event horizon .   ( more is on the way with contact and alien : ressurection being released later this year . )  the story is thus : in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive .  a device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe , instantaneously .  this is achieved by creating a gateway , infact , a black hole , between the craft and it's required destination .  in this case , from near neptune to proxima prime .  however , when the event horizon attempts this , it dissappears , without trace , leaving two searches for it fruitless .  seven years later , it reappears , transmitting a distress signal and this is where the film starts .  a search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate .  the team is led by laurence fishburne , and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive .  as the team search the event horizon , they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around .  not a good sign . . .  to make matters worse , as they search the ship , they find themselves being subjected to a series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse , some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago .  it soon becomes apparent that , wherever the ship went , it bought something back with it .  something very , very evil . . .  the first thing you'll notice in this film is it's incredible visual effects .  they really are eye popping , with some great models to boot .  the acting is quite good , with some occasional witty moments .  sam neill does a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more and more disturbed as the search continues , but a tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads the team , in a cool , calm , take no nonense manner .  it is his acting skills that help hold this film together .  the idea behind event horizon is certainly a good one .  it starts off incredibly well , but the middle section becomes quite confused and sometimes muddled , leaving the viewer unsure on just what the reasons are behind some of the bloody and bizarre events that occur .  however , the closing 20 minutes of the film more than make up for this , producing one the most nail biting ( or in my case , straw of my drink biting ! )  climaxes i've recently witnessed .  overall , event horizon is a smart film indeed .  it's very enjoyable and has some amazing visuals .  but be warned , the horror scenes , despite being very brief are very , very , gory .  not for the squemish !  
1 jerry springer has got nothing on " wild things . "  john mcnaughton's new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer's notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality , threesomes , poolside catfights , slutty rich bimbos , even redneck gator-wrestling , they're all part of the movie's raucous , complex storyline .  but even trash tv topicality can't drag " wild things " down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you'd find late-night on the usa network , only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast .  despite a smattering of needless scenes ( most of them sexual in nature ) , there's wicked fun to be had here .   " wild things " would be a guilty pleasure , only there's no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it .  high school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well-liked in the town of blue bay , especially by pretty , popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave's most financially prominent .  hoping to take her crush to a physical level , kelly seductively slinks into lombardo's house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser , but , the very next day , tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped .  before long , blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly's rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell ) .  lombardo , who maintains his innocence , hires neck brace-sporting , opportunistic lawyer ken bowden ( bill murray ) to defend him in court .  the previews give away the following revelations , so if you haven't seen any of the movie's spots on the television or in the theater , you might want to skip to the next paragraph .  while cross-examining suzie on the witness stand , bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her .  to pay lombardo for the damages , kelly's mother breaks her daughter's trust fund and gives him $8 . 5 million .  but lombardo , kelly and suzie are actually all working together , and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can .  duquette and perez , however , begin to suspect that there's more afoot to the case than just false accusations .  if there's a major drawback to " wild things , " it's that it's oversexed to a fault .  the much-talked-about hotel room menage-a-trois between dillon , campbell and richards is a turn-off .  it's also cut short ( sorry , guys ) , and should have been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often .  what we don't see is far more effective than what we do .  another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene .  er , no thanks .  also , bacon's duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten .  daphne rubin-vega , from broadway's " rent , " tries to compensate for a superfluous character .  theresa russell is just plain wooden .  and when , in the end , all is out in the open , ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary .  but what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises ( some predictable , some not ) that never seems to end .   " wild things " has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews , and most are so gleefully , over-the-top nasty that you can't help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship .  a great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent ; murray's a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo's case and flipping them off .  and don't leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you'll miss the film's best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell .  speaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in " starship troopers . "  matt dillon flexes his sleepy-voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision .  neve campbell , lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig , gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio .  re-edited and toned down a bit , the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths .  but what we're given works well enough .   " wild things " is highly entertaining and , indeed , very wild .  
0 well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you .  because thats all that there really is . . . .  i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot .  for one thing , a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity . . . .  i am not saying that this isn't possible . .  but it does leave one to wonder . . . i  know i did .  another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out . . . .  and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations .  there was one scene that should have been short . . .  but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking . .  ok enough already get on with it .  there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do . . .  things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort . . .  another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning .  this movie is also very predictable . . .  you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment . .  granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you .  also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated . . .  it gets boring at times to tell you the truth . . .  even though there is still action going on .  another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero .  some of the characters are not proper for their roles .  the acting is fine but the characters just don't seem to add up .  if i was to base my review totally on the plot then i wouldn't rate this movie too highly but that's just the thing this movie isn't just the plot , its the whole package and this package is really well done .  the whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie .  the special effects are just amazing , you can't tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live , in a few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just wouldn't be able to say that the creature wasn't there during filming , extinct or not .  another thing is the destruction scenes . . .  wow , those were masterpieces . .  well some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dino's make this one of the reasons to see this movie .  this movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office . .  unfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do . .  i may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments . .  go see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me .  one little side note , although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid , there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock i think that some people really want money badly . . . .  and i think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance . . . .  you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made . . . . .  i thought i'd put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick . . .  its not that bad a movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this .  
1 in `enemy at the gates' , jude law is a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov ( joseph fiennes ) who uses him in a propaganda newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers and people of stalingrad .  it's world war ii , and the russian-german standoff in town could determine the outcome of things for the motherland .  law's vassili is the russian's top pawn to victory .  lots of war stuff happens .  an older , german version of jude's character played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings .  he's equally talented , and the two men play a cat and mouse game trying to kill each other .  they constantly switch roles , as the war fades far into the background .  the cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest for both vassili and danilov  the set-up is decent , and so are the production values .  boasting a wide range of grimy locales , greasy hair , and tattered costumes , the art direction prospers .  the actors , however , suffer the problem matt damon had in `saving private ryan' .  either their eyes , teeth , skin , or a combination of other features looked too white and clean .  with dirt and blood all around , the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action .  that said , the players are mostly good in their roles , although i don't think ed harris was really trying .  maybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord in one-notedom .  while the film is technically about snipers , there are far too many predictable sniping scenes .  director jean-jacques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude and some cohort in a tight spot as edgy and exciting , but after about the sixth time , in which we realize that jude is not going to die , it's relatively pointless .  we get that he's talented , okay , let's move on .  that's the problem with `enemy at the gates' ; it just doesn't know when to stop .  witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere .  reestablishing his title as the most beautiful ( and often talented ) man on film , jude law carries the movie .  without him , this costly production would have gone into the ground .  the story and acting are of good quality , but there's never a sense of authenticity or reality .  something about this war movie is undeniably modern , and it loses its feeling .  strange enough , the screenplay is based on the true story of a real russian sniper .  
0 i'm not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream , but i'm guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft .  seriously , this idea--a psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends--is a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off .  the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue .  an example : " that [car crash] must've been awful . . . for  everyone involved . "  you can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said , just no one figured out what .  i know in slasher movies there isn't supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself don't mind cardboard cutouts , but please don't let the cutouts be so damn bland .  one reason movies like scream , star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters .  aside from jared leto and joshua jackson ( who aren't on the screen long enough ) no one in urban legend makes the grade .  alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill , rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive ( not to mention as dumb as a post through 3/4 of the film ) and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot .  good thing brad dourif is here , but wait . . . he's only in the movie for five minutes _and_ he's just redoing his good-natured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoo's nest .  which brings me to another aspect of urban legend : it's unoriginality .  the film most blatantly ripped off is scream ( another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven's and williamson's great success ) .  urban legend tries to deconstruct modern-day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films , but it doesn't quite succeed .  it's best stab at self-reflexivity is poking fun at " that girl in the noxzeema ad " ( ie , rebecca gayheart ) we also have another killer-taunting-his-victim-on-the-phone routine in urban legend and quick , what movie is this exchange of dialogue from :  female protagonist : why ?  villain : why ?  why ? ! ?  congratulations to those of you who answered scream and/or urban legend .  like i said , this movie could've been great .  if only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script .  still , at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer .  
1 any movie about the underground music scene is a difficult beast to master .  any meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbing-down of the experience to make it " more accessible " to the general public .  or the film is produced and directed by people that have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to work as production assistants for vh1 .  human traffic , a new film exploring the british underground party/rave scene and the people immersed in the world of clubbing , pubbing , drugs , sex , and the beautiful , beautiful music , is an example of how it really ought to be done .  the film follows five brits in their young twenties during a wild weekend of parties , drugs , dancing , sex , pop culture discussions , relationships , and wanking off in front of a mirror while mum interrupts .  the cast of character consists of jip ( john simm ) , our narrator , who has a bit of a problem with his willy , known as mr . floppy .  koop ( shaun parkes ) , our black dj maestro , who has insecurity issues , afraid his girlfriend nina ( nicola reynolds ) is shagging other men .  nina herself can't stand her mcjob and longs for the freedom of the weekends .  lulu ( lorraine pilkington ) , jip's best mate , is tired of her cheating boyfriends .  and moff ( danny dyer ) can't seem to escape the black hole of his awful life .  the film follows these five individuals during one weekend as each of them discovers love , friendship , and self-fulfillment , all against the raging party background .  human traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while being visually alive , as director justin kerrigan's subtle use of the camera lets the audience become part of the action .  the use of direct communication to the audience by the collection of characters works well , making the viewer the subconscious mind for the characters .  dialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace , and the acting is confident .  however , the two females leads tend to promote their relationships and dialogue with a bit of unneeded urgency that shows through when poignancy is needed .  human traffic does not try to explain the rave scene .  instead , it gives the audience the ability to listen to the people inside it , letting you choose your own convictions about this powerful musical movement that brings together strangers , friends , and lovers for one blissful night of music and peace .  
1 i rented " brokedown palace " last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws .  for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety .  that is no easy task .  superficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably " return to paradise " and " midnight express . "  as a result nearly every review of " brokedown palace " i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons .  the consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film .  for those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was " midnight express " ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of " return to paradise . "  in my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad's acclaimed novel , " lord jim . "  problematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world " justice " system .  the girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) .  they're life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents .  once there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside .  they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl's scam .  he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene .  by now alarm bells are going off among viewers .  the ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don't add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice .  long before it happens , we're anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin .  just as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch .  left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice .  for those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl's fleabag hotel .  as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer " yankee hank " ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife .  a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film's tag lines , " who do you trust ? , " and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman's oeuvre will find few surprises .  much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion .  lou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments .  is he part of a wider conspiracy ?  with an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them .  the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls' interaction , hank's investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape .  if " brokedown palace " has a major flaw , it is its creators' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story's main avenue .  and , if that were all there was to " brokedown palace , " it wouldn't be a very good movie .  but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded .  for the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations .  ultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing .  young and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure .  presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) .  clear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend .  she comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) .  whereas darlene's life is " on-track , " aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and " fulfillment , " alice's is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning .  one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo .  tellingly , alice is present but not included .  just as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice's face doesn't read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while " dar " remains seated in the shade .   " brokedown palace " begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank .  however unintentional , it's all alice's fault .  she's responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick .   ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film's beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . )  dar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence .  never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate .  dar is innocent .  it doesn't matter .  alice is the subject of this movie .  she and her journey toward personal freedom .  along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals .  in the end , that culture , like its representatives , " yankee " hank and dar's father ( a " man who knows how to grease the wheels " ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl's tragedy .  thailand's culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison .  it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes .  i believe the filmmaker's view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior .  the thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles .  the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born .  their prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit .  the prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and " hard manual labor " consisted of picking grass !  the thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic .  as for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film's penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality .  'freedom' has many faces and " brokedown palace " explores many of them .  in the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit .  some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter .  but freedom seldom comes without a price .  which is why the movie's other tag lines are : " what is your dream ? "  and " how far would you go ? "  i believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film's end is alice .  she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility .  i think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact .  kate beckinsale's character might more properly be likened to the " released " temple bird referred to twice during the film , " trained to fly back to its cage . "  as the thai magistrate observed in the film's climactic scene , the issue was always one of " character ; " and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that " freedom " is achieved within oneself .  if one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ?  increasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of 'kung fu woman'--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures .  here , at last , is the story of a modern heroine .  in reading the many user's comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors .  think about that .  when was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ?  do yourself a favor : rent " brokedown palace " and watch it with a open mind .  there's more there than meets the eye .  
0 ugh . that about sums this movie up .  just , ugh .  the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic , and when reviewing the previous films , each film had a certain degree of intelligence .  and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following ; in spite of bad special effects , horrible dubbing , and a man in a lizard suit , they maintained a certain degree of . . . how to put this ? . . .  dignity ?  not quite the word i'm looking for .  you understand , right ?  and in 50 years , godzilla has maintained that degree of 'whatever' .  leave it to america to screw the whole thing up .  >from the 'geniuses' that brought us " independece day " , arguably the worst sci-fi movie of all time , to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had .  while they do bring us eye-popping special effects that will amaze you , they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies -- a storyline .  summing up the movie is simple .  heck , i can do it in one sentence : giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of nobodies stop it .  simple as that .  matthew broderick stumbles over his lines , and it's hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dog-walking character on the television show " mad about you " .  the dialogue seems to be improvized , almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all .  i can see the scene on the set right now .   " all right !  we spent all of this money making big special effects , and we've gotta get this movie out by summer or it's going to bomb in our faces .  so , you actors just say what ever comes to the top of your head , all right ?  make up something , m'kay ?  good .  roll film ! ! "  the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing , and some of the cinemtography is well-done ( the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind ) .  still , an hour into it , you will become antsy , wondering how long they can drag it out .  and drag it out they do ! !  i have to laugh .  the slogan for the film is , " size does matter " .  i think they cut this too short .  it should read , " size does matter .  acting does not . "  
1 alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters .  i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn't like it .  of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault .  in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor .  james cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series .  i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality .  many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action .  both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written .  as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion .  perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped .  on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see .  it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh .  i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities .  don't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting .  however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters .  as a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters .  we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie .  there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt . ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films .  the other character was dr . clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs .  alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off .  the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry .  without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film .  an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card .  we see lt . ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments . . .   ( title ) . . .  a shot of an alien egg . . .   ( title ) . . .  alien legs stretch up into the air . . .   ( title ) . . .  and so on and so on .  during these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed .  it's quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time .  because of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison .  however , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod .  unfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed .  ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery .  of course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates .  ripley is revived and asks to see the ship .  after seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated .  this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films .  featuring a monologue from dillon ( charles s . dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog's demise .  it's one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog .  and this is where alien 3 succeeds .  fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both ) .  fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films .  alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images .  by doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise .  many people have criticized fincher's filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal .  showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived .  i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron .  however , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn't want to see die ) .  why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don't plan on spoiling that in this review .  >from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever .  in alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane's stomach .  in aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine .  alien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley .  ripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her .  why it doesn't kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending .  fincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces .  many critics didn't like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot .  most of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher's turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that's not always a bad thing .  the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists .  again , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off .  however , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron's film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run-down prison .  as a result , no weapons are to be found .  this creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense .  as an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself , it is an extremely well-made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not .  the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one-dimensional characters .  i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about .  despite this , ripley was the central figure , and that's what is important .  we care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys .  again , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions .  while cameron's version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets .  the cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie .  the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around .  the yellows , reds , and oranges of the lights create a dark mood , and by themselves create a lot of suspense .  shadows dance on the walls , and yet those shadows could easily be the alien .  the alien is different from its predecessors this time around , and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense .  the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien , racing after the characters .  the sets are quite incredible , which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien .  the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed .  the sets appear to be in the future , but not too far in the future .  one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien ( nothing surprising there ) .  sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance , equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens .  she was snubbed at the oscars for this one , mainly because the film was a critical bomb .  her reactions are far more realistic in this film , with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter .  it's quite touching really .  charles s . dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates , and i was on the brink of actually caring for him .  charles dance turns in a nice low-key performance , and as a result , i cared for him immediately .  lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii , but he was more entertaining in aliens .  the rest of the cast is pretty stale , though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world .  alien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language , and sex .  although it has its flaws , alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism .  this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie .  while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films , fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out .  it's a film like fincher's which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity ( the final scene ) .  in fact , it tells us that we , as a society , have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little " fake . "  whenever something looks fake on screen , we immediately point it out as a mistake .  but perhaps it isn't a mistake .  
1 nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 )  a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson  this extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker's " dracula " by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore .  inspired by f . w . murnau's 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog's film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards .  the original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u . s . distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints .  until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe .  both of these re-releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue .  apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed .  the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one .  everyone knows the story of dracula .  or do they ?  his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won't hurt .  jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker's hometown .  upon seeing a photo of harker's wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her .  locking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him .  upon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises .  that is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker's tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art .  nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue-ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised .  the film's surreal , dream-like quality is utterly mesmerising .  there is much to enjoy , but i'll limit my praise to a few key points .  holding the film together is kinski's remarkable performance as count dracula .  past screen portrayals , including bela lugosi's famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp .  but kinski . . . oh boy , this is something far more compelling .  aided by a startling make-up job , he portrays dracula's vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease .  this man is dreadfully lonely .  he lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust .  kinski's portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting .  when he dies , you almost feel as if this man's tortured soul has been freed at last .  then there's the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh .  it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it's quite impossible to imagine the film without it .  popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient-sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments .  when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums .  the one i still listen to the most is " tantric songs " , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken .  it's a testament to the music's depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them .  the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies .  this is a timely re-release by anchor bay .  after francis ford coppola's unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker's tale in 1992 , it is a joy to go back to herzog's film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century-old story .  to some aficionados , nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made .  without a doubt , it is an unmistakable classic of the genre .  don't miss it .  
1 there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie .  action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle .  for fans of both genres , however , realism is key .  action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end .  on this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr .  moreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin .  the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years .  the script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago .  a certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times .  frankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck .  his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it .  robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time .  he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package .  the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik .  at times , however , zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise's computer disk .  fortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened .  the action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews .  the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness .  ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots .  the suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie's open .  considering these factors it's good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it's another good bet this month .  since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it's definitely worth the visit .  
0 ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking .  these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous .  if it's not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect .  hackers is guilty of all of these crimes .  to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can't take it anymore .  those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled " goofs " .  this is the section for mistakes in the movies .  well , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : " generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology " .  and truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct .  the plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking .  more specifically , it follows the exploits of dade murphy , a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller .  miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting , because if it were not for that , who knows where his career would be now after hackers .  the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems .  he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old .  the film then picks up at that point , an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer .  dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn ( angelina jolie ) , cereal killer ( matthew lillard ) , lord nikon ( laurence mason ) , and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible : hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi .  oh , and as a little sub-plot , dade also tries to woo acid burn , the only female hacker in the film .  really , i can't think of much more to say about the film's plot aside from what i've said .  it's just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi .  thanks to this movie , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do .  this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time , and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list .  to sum it up , hackers is a terrible computer film .  if you're looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world , i suggest sneakers .  although at times it too may seem a little far fetched , it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users .  hopefully , this film didn't influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time .  
1 on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo .  two months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides .  this little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in " lumumba . "  patrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , " lumumba - death of a prophet , " virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject .  peck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader .  we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men .  images of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image .  jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo .  a third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader .  his small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville .  at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc .  as the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) .  the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more .  lumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government .  his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination .  the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad .  this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries .  peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's .   ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them .  some colonial masters were better than others . )  the effort involved in " lumumba " is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all .  production values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget .  the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique .  the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba's life .  the political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches .  it concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn't embellish on a larger than life persona .  the family side of patrice's life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child .  i know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba .  the story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it .  high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character .  the actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions .  in true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead .   " lumumba " is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both .  it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i've seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ .  
1 krippendorf's tribe is a formula comedy .  done poorly , formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema .  however , every now and then , one emerges , like krippendorf's tribe , that actually works .  professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) , the renowned anthropologist , is in trouble .  his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea .  however , he found . . . nothing .  his wife has recently died , and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids : shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) and edmund ( carl michael lidner ) .  tonight , he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe .  rather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) , he invents a tribe : the shelmikedmu ( named after his kids ) .  however , one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu , but his research becomes a popular phenomenon .  soon , professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members .  his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over-eager colleague , veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) .  krippendorf's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief .  no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes .  luckily , as the film builds momentum , that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by .  though there's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe , the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies .  the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable , and the comic timing required for some of the film's latter scenes is superb .  richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe .  jenna elfman's position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times , but she plays the part with extreme affability .  even the kids , who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side , are endearing and humorous .  yes , the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor , but it has the best excuse of all : it's funny .  it may not go down as an all-time classic , but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy : plenty of laughs .  
0 since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993's steven spielberg drama " schindler's list " and directed 1993's intelligent " searching for bobby fischer , " his new film , " a civil action , " should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career .  what doesn't make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective .  the film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama .  based on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , " a civil action " is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children's death from leukemia due to unknown causes .  jan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city's drinking water .  suddenly , after hearing about the families' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out .  also figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case .  coming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , " a civil action " is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience .  perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning .  watching the film , i couldn't help but notice its similarities with 1997's far , far superior film " the sweet hereafter , " which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children .  in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home .  not only was the plotting similar to " a civil action , " but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes .  considering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful " a sweet hereafter " was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm's character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl .  in " a civil action , " however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness .  we do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters .  through its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta's lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn't appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job .  every scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for .  you've got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what " a civil action " does .  to be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked .  aside from one flashback to when a man's young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering .  i could say the performances were good , but who's fooling who ?  since every character is one-dimensionally written , no one's acting abilities are challenged in any way .  travolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that's about all he does .  duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets .  and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture's final scene , as a judge ?  she appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ?  finally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ?  abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , " a civil action " seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with .  
0 so ask yourself what " 8mm " ( " eight millimeter " ) is really all about .  is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ?  is it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there's a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ?  or is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ?  i'm not talking about snuff films , supposed " documentaries " of victims being brutalized and killed on camera .  i'm talking about films like " 8mm " and its director , joel schumacher .  with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- " batman & robin , " " a time to kill , " " batman forever , " " the client " --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence .  is " 8mm " something you really want to see ?  probably not .  the first two-thirds of " 8mm " unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core .  then , as it's been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence .  and just when you think it's finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further .  trust me .  there are better ways to waste two hours of your life .  nicolas ' " snake eyes " ' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband's safe documents a young girl's murder .  welles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don't need any specialized skills or training to do this .  welles certainly makes it look easy .  and cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues .  the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schrader's " hardcore . "  occasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task .  there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa .   " 8mm " doesn't condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it .  the irony , of course , is that schumacher and " seven " scribe andrew kevin walker's vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product .  so we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror .  later it's the turn of joaquin phoenix ( who's quite good and by far the film's most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again .  all this to get to the familiar yet offensive " revelation " that sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me .  neither super nor standard , " 8mm " is shocking only in its banality .  
1 i rented this movie with very high hopes .  this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking .  first of all , the casting for this film is great .  tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood .  they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly .  with a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast .  tobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability .  william h . macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a " colored " person and his friends , the " non-colored " ones .  he also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife .  he does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood .  joan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom .  her character is the most ambitious .  she is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that .  her lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better .  as said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance .  his character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction .  his character is very confusing and he is not very believable .  this film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance .  the movie is very provocative .  it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today .  i really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing .  they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace .  the only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length .  some films are not meant to be that long .  pleasantville is one of those films .  this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it .  first , they are amazed by the implementation of color .  then they want to have it .  then they do not want to .  then the war ensues between the colored and non-colored .  this is all strung out over two hours , which was way too long .  some movies need a lot of time .  saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time .  this film is only two hours long , and seems much longer .  length is everything in films .  if you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle .  pleasantville can move at a good pace at times , but it is not consistent enough .  overall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days .  i went in expecting a light-hearted film about change .  i left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change .  luckily , pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences .  only if it could have done in a shorter amount of time .  
0 american pie 2 is filled with laughs .  but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater .  i'm no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy .  but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment , not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself .  what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart .  of the original , i noted it was " a warm , pleasant outing about the travails of growing up . "  well , the quartet of chums - jim ( jason biggs ) , oz ( chris klein ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) - have grown up .  at least they are a year older , but don't seem any wiser .  fresh from their first year of college the quartet , along with the obnoxious stifler ( seann william scott ) , rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score .  as usual nothing goes right until the last reel .  but what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women .  and american pie 2 is rather degrading to women .  for the most part , they are not shown as individuals .  they are nothing more than potential recipients of over-active , raging hormones .  it is telling that the most normal couple , oz and heather ( mena suvari ) spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex - she's overseas on an exchange student program .  despite having been to college , jim is still klutzy and awkward , unsure of himself around the opposite sex .  most of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him , including a painful episode involving an instant glue-like substance .  also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates , whom the boys suspect of being lesbians .  it is offensive and plays upon outdated , adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs .  the first film , despite some raunchy moments , had an innocent charm to it .  the sequel is more cynical .  it knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them : the many mentions of finch's encounter with stifler's mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy's return as jim's well-meaning , trying-to-be-hip dad .  the only performer who is actually given some new , fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle , the band geek from the original .  in the sequel , she imbues her character with vulnerability , wisdom and maturity .  american pie 2 is a pre-sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office .  it is a shame , though , that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz , who also penned the original , could not have set his sights higher .  american pie 2 is funny , but it's still a comedown as well as a letdown .
